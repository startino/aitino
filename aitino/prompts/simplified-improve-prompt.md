Prompt engineering
This guide shares strategies and tactics for getting better results from large language models (sometimes referred to as GPT models) like GPT-4. The methods described here can sometimes be deployed in combination for greater effect. We encourage experimentation to find the methods that work best for you.

Some of the examples demonstrated here currently work only with our most capable model, gpt-4. In general, if you find that a model fails at a task and a more capable model is available, it's often worth trying again with the more capable model.

You can also explore example prompts which showcase what our models are capable of:

Six strategies for getting better results
Write clear instructions
These models can’t read your mind. If outputs are too long, ask for brief replies. If outputs are too simple, ask for expert-level writing. If you dislike the format, demonstrate the format you’d like to see. The less the model has to guess at what you want, the more likely you’ll get it.

Tactics:

Include details in your query to get more relevant answers
Ask the model to adopt a persona
Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
Specify the steps required to complete a task
Provide examples
Specify the desired length of the output
Provide reference text
Language models can confidently invent fake answers, especially when asked about esoteric topics or for citations and URLs. In the same way that a sheet of notes can help a student do better on a test, providing reference text to these models can help in answering with fewer fabrications.

Tactics:

Instruct the model to answer using a reference text
Instruct the model to answer with citations from a reference text
Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks
Just as it is good practice in software engineering to decompose a complex system into a set of modular components, the same is true of tasks submitted to a language model. Complex tasks tend to have higher error rates than simpler tasks. Furthermore, complex tasks can often be re-defined as a workflow of simpler tasks in which the outputs of earlier tasks are used to construct the inputs to later tasks.

Tactics:

Use intent classification to identify the most relevant instructions for a user query
For dialogue applications that require very long conversations, summarize or filter previous dialogue
Summarize long documents piecewise and construct a full summary recursively
Give the model time to "think"
If asked to multiply 17 by 28, you might not know it instantly, but can still work it out with time. Similarly, models make more reasoning errors when trying to answer right away, rather than taking time to work out an answer. Asking for a "chain of thought" before an answer can help the model reason its way toward correct answers more reliably.

Tactics:

Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
Use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process
Ask the model if it missed anything on previous passes
Use external tools
Compensate for the weaknesses of the model by feeding it the outputs of other tools. For example, a text retrieval system (sometimes called RAG or retrieval augmented generation) can tell the model about relevant documents. A code execution engine like OpenAI's Code Interpreter can help the model do math and run code. If a task can be done more reliably or efficiently by a tool rather than by a language model, offload it to get the best of both.

Tactics:

Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval
Use code execution to perform more accurate calculations or call external APIs
Give the model access to specific functions
Test changes systematically
Improving performance is easier if you can measure it. In some cases a modification to a prompt will achieve better performance on a few isolated examples but lead to worse overall performance on a more representative set of examples. Therefore to be sure that a change is net positive to performance it may be necessary to define a comprehensive test suite (also known an as an "eval").

Tactic:

Evaluate model outputs with reference to gold-standard answers

Tactics
Each of the strategies listed above can be instantiated with specific tactics. These tactics are meant to provide ideas for things to try.

Strategy: Write clear instructions
Tactic: Include details in your query to get more relevant answers
In order to get a highly relevant response, make sure that requests provide any important details or context. Otherwise you are leaving it up to the model to guess what you mean.
Tactic: Ask the model to adopt a persona
The system message can be used to specify the persona used by the model in its replies.
Tactic: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
Delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, section titles, etc. can help demarcate sections of text to be treated differently. Make sure to include exactly what you are looking for in the prompt.
Tactic: Specify the steps required to complete a task
Some tasks are best specified as a sequence of steps. Writing the steps out explicitly can make it easier for the model to follow them.
Tactic: Provide examples
Providing general instructions that apply to all examples is generally more efficient than demonstrating all permutations of a task by example, but in some cases providing examples may be easier. For example, if you intend for the model to copy a particular style of responding to user queries which is difficult to describe explicitly. This is known as "few-shot" prompting.
Tactic: Specify the desired length of the output
You can ask the model to produce outputs that are of a given target length. The targeted output length can be specified in terms of the count of words, sentences, paragraphs, bullet points, etc. Note however that instructing the model to generate a specific number of words does not work with high precision. The model can more reliably generate outputs with a specific number of paragraphs or bullet points.

Strategy: Provide reference text
Tactic: Instruct the model to answer using a reference text
If we can provide a model with trusted information that is relevant to the current query, then we can instruct the model to use the provided information to compose its answer. Given that all models have limited context windows, we need some way to dynamically lookup information that is relevant to the question being asked. Embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval. See the tactic "Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval" for more details on how to implement this.
Tactic: Instruct the model to answer with citations from a reference text
If the input has been supplemented with relevant knowledge, it's straightforward to request that the model add citations to its answers by referencing passages from provided documents. Note that citations in the output can then be verified programmatically by string matching within the provided documents.

Strategy: Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks
Tactic: Use intent classification to identify the most relevant instructions for a user query
For tasks in which lots of independent sets of instructions are needed to handle different cases, it can be beneficial to first classify the type of query and to use that classification to determine which instructions are needed. This can be achieved by defining fixed categories and hardcoding instructions that are relevant for handling tasks in a given category. This process can also be applied recursively to decompose a task into a sequence of stages. The advantage of this approach is that each query will contain only those instructions that are required to perform the next stage of a task which can result in lower error rates compared to using a single query to perform the whole task. This can also result in lower costs since larger prompts cost more to run (see pricing information). Based on the classification of the customer query, a set of more specific instructions can be provided to a model for it to handle next steps. For example, suppose the customer requires help with "troubleshooting".
SYSTEM
You will be provided with customer service inquiries that require troubleshooting in a technical support context. Help the user by:

- Ask them to check that all cables to/from the router are connected. Note that it is common for cables to come loose over time.
- If all cables are connected and the issue persists, ask them which router model they are using
- Now you will advise them how to restart their device:
-- If the model number is MTD-327J, advise them to push the red button and hold it for 5 seconds, then wait 5 minutes before testing the connection.
-- If the model number is MTD-327S, advise them to unplug and replug it, then wait 5 minutes before testing the connection.
- If the customer's issue persists after restarting the device and waiting 5 minutes, connect them to IT support by outputting {"IT support requested"}.
- If the user starts asking questions that are unrelated to this topic then confirm if they would like to end the current chat about troubleshooting and classify their request according to the following scheme:

<insert primary/secondary classification scheme from above here>
USER
I need to get my internet working again.
Notice that the model has been instructed to emit special strings to indicate when the state of the conversation changes. This enables us to turn our system into a state machine where the state determines which instructions are injected. By keeping track of state, what instructions are relevant at that state, and also optionally what state transitions are allowed from that state, we can put guardrails around the user experience that would be hard to achieve with a less structured approach.
Tactic: For dialogue applications that require very long conversations, summarize or filter previous dialogue
Since models have a fixed context length, dialogue between a user and an assistant in which the entire conversation is included in the context window cannot continue indefinitely.

There are various workarounds to this problem, one of which is to summarize previous turns in the conversation. Once the size of the input reaches a predetermined threshold length, this could trigger a query that summarizes part of the conversation and the summary of the prior conversation could be included as part of the system message. Alternatively, prior conversation could be summarized asynchronously in the background throughout the entire conversation.

An alternative solution is to dynamically select previous parts of the conversation that are most relevant to the current query. See the tactic "Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval".
Tactic: Summarize long documents piecewise and construct a full summary recursively
Since models have a fixed context length, they cannot be used to summarize a text longer than the context length minus the length of the generated summary in a single query.

To summarize a very long document such as a book we can use a sequence of queries to summarize each section of the document. Section summaries can be concatenated and summarized producing summaries of summaries. This process can proceed recursively until an entire document is summarized. If it’s necessary to use information about earlier sections in order to make sense of later sections, then a further trick that can be useful is to include a running summary of the text that precedes any given point in the book while summarizing content at that point. The effectiveness of this procedure for summarizing books has been studied in previous research by OpenAI using variants of GPT-3.

Strategy: Give models time to "think"
Tactic: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
Sometimes we get better results when we explicitly instruct the model to reason from first principles before coming to a conclusion. Suppose for example we want a model to evaluate a student’s solution to a math problem. The most obvious way to approach this is to simply ask the model if the student's solution is correct or not.

But suppose the student's solution is not correct. We can get the model to notice this by prompting it to generate its own solution first.
Tactic: Use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process
The previous tactic demonstrates that it is sometimes important for the model to reason in detail about a problem before answering a specific question. For some applications, the reasoning process that a model uses to arrive at a final answer would be inappropriate to share with the user. For example, in tutoring applications we may want to encourage students to work out their own answers, but a model’s reasoning process about the student’s solution could reveal the answer to the student.

Inner monologue is a tactic that can be used to mitigate this. The idea of inner monologue is to instruct the model to put parts of the output that are meant to be hidden from the user into a structured format that makes parsing them easy. Then before presenting the output to the user, the output is parsed and only part of the output is made visible Alternatively, this can be achieved with a sequence of queries in which all except the last have their output hidden from the end user.

First, we can ask the model to solve the problem on its own. Since this initial query doesn't require the student’s solution, it can be omitted. This provides the additional advantage that there is no chance that the model’s solution will be biased by the student’s attempted solution. Next, we can have the model use all available information to assess the correctness of the student’s solution. Finally, we can let the model use its own analysis to construct a reply in the persona of a helpful tutor.
Tactic: Ask the model if it missed anything on previous passes
Suppose that we are using a model to list excerpts from a source which are relevant to a particular question. After listing each excerpt the model needs to determine if it should start writing another or if it should stop. If the source document is large, it is common for a model to stop too early and fail to list all relevant excerpts. In that case, better performance can often be obtained by prompting the model with followup queries to find any excerpts it missed on previous passes.

Strategy: Use external tools
Tactic: Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval
A model can leverage external sources of information if provided as part of its input. This can help the model to generate more informed and up-to-date responses. For example, if a user asks a question about a specific movie, it may be useful to add high quality information about the movie (e.g. actors, director, etc…) to the model’s input. Embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval, so that relevant information can be added to the model input dynamically at run-time.

A text embedding is a vector that can measure the relatedness between text strings. Similar or relevant strings will be closer together than unrelated strings. This fact, along with the existence of fast vector search algorithms means that embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval. In particular, a text corpus can be split up into chunks, and each chunk can be embedded and stored. Then a given query can be embedded and vector search can be performed to find the embedded chunks of text from the corpus that are most related to the query (i.e. closest together in the embedding space).

Example implementations can be found in the OpenAI Cookbook. See the tactic “Instruct the model to use retrieved knowledge to answer queries” for an example of how to use knowledge retrieval to minimize the likelihood that a model will make up incorrect facts.

Tactic: Use code execution to perform more accurate calculations or call external APIs
Language models cannot be relied upon to perform arithmetic or long calculations accurately on their own. In cases where this is needed, a model can be instructed to write and run code instead of making its own calculations. In particular, a model can be instructed to put code that is meant to be run into a designated format such as triple backtick. After an output is produced, the code can be extracted and run. Finally, if necessary, the output from the code execution engine (i.e. Python interpreter) can be provided as an input to the model for the next query. Another good use case for code execution is calling external APIs. If a model is instructed in the proper use of an API, it can write code that makes use of it. A model can be instructed in how to use an API by providing it with documentation and/or code samples showing how to use the API.
Tactic: Give the model access to specific functions
The Chat Completions API allows passing a list of function descriptions in requests. This enables models to generate function arguments according to the provided schemas. Generated function arguments are returned by the API in JSON format and can be used to execute function calls. Output provided by function calls can then be fed back into a model in the following request to close the loop. This is the recommended way of using OpenAI models to call external functions. To learn more see the function calling section in our introductory text generation guide and more function calling examples in the OpenAI Cookbook.
