2. Friendship's Code: Navigating Tech Dreams with New Connections
I have an idea I want to pursue but lack technical skills.
I'm unsure about asking my new friend for help on this idea because our friendship is still new
Should I start learning to code, create a prototype, and then hire a CTO later? Or should I focus on a service business first and then launch a tech product?
Any advice on navigating this new connection or the next steps would be appreciated.

3. Hype me up or dissuade me
I'm a business analyst with a fully specced out app and have been approaching Devs for the build for a web app/hybrid app mvp.
Initial estimates are around $25000 but I was initially (potentially naievely) hoping for something around $10000...
Question is.. go forward or take a step back, more market/customer research/potentially find investment etc...

4. I have an interesting for an App, but I have no coding experience. Looking for someone with coding experience.
Hi everyone! I have an idea for an app that I think could generate a lot of traction, however, I have no coding or computer science background.
I am a law student (close to graduating).
Where can I find someone who would be interested in joining this with me? Also, does anyone here have experience with having AI write code for them? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

5. If have an idea for an app and have the finances to build, where do I start?
This pitch for a successful application.
I’m currently a successful business owner in Long Island and own about 10 laundromats. I’m looking into reviving this old profession, as I can see a vision of it, being way more useful now than it was before given the technology.
I just want to know is it hard to get an application off the ground and be successful? I’m willing to invest about $800,000-$1 million.
I do have a bachelors degree in business and entrepreneurship. Does anyone have recommendations for services in nyc that help build a start up?
