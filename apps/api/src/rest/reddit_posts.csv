The Art of High Level Sales,"So you've been looking at improving some sales skills or getting into sales as a career. Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this obviously. While sales comes naturally to some, there is a collection of small details you can take from each to improve your game. Some are naturally great a building rapport, some just speak with confidence, or some just have that natural aura that people feel comfortable around them. Those secrets will be exactly what this series covers. Starting with understanding how high level sales is an art form that can be replicated.   
  
  
  
  
  
One of the saddest mistakes a large majority of business owners and sales managers make is not training their sales people. Not having the right tools to perform the job leads to mediocre performance and high turnover rate. Sales is stressful enough, then add figuring it all out on your own. Most sales reps just mimic what they saw before and hope that works. You need to educated yourself. You'll hear me say this a lot throughout this series.   
  
  
  
Everything Is Hard Until You Understand It.   
  
  
  
Jiujitsu is an extremely technical sport. The better your technique the better you perform. Black belts take about 10 years to get on average. Just a decade of repetition and improving your skill set. Michael Phelps swam 8 hours a day for years without missing a day. Just improving technique and skills.  Imagine if you put that kind of effort into improving your sales technique and skills.   
  
  
  
While sales is hard to feel comfortable in at first. This playbook will give you the foundation early on to start succeeding and near the end, if you are following everything, you should be exceeding all your other reps. I'm going to teach you rapport building like I learned when I was a Human Intelligence Collector in the army. For those of you that don't know, that's the guy that does interrogations and convinces people to spy on their friends for our interest.  
  
  
  
We will be going over how to approach, where to look, posture, your tone, active listening, building a network and so much more. Everything I've learned over the last 14 years of doing every type of sales and always coming out on top.   
  
  
  
That's it for now. Pt. 2 will be Understanding the Sales Process. I'm going to cover an ideal sales process and how approaching it as a step by step system will significantly reduce the stress and give you confidence to close more consistently.

If you are in sales or interested in getting into sales, feel free to send me any questions you might have. I have no problem helping give some advice. I don't charge you for anything unless we're doing real coaching. If you have any request for information to be added to the playbook, just let me know. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  I want this to be a tool you can use over and over for your entire career. Thank for you time. See you on the next one.

I’m in my second year of medical school in my country. I‘m the oldest and only boy in a family of 7. My family falls in the category of lower middle class with lots of financial constraints.   


My parents are getting old and tired from the low quality of food and life and the tons of efforts they exert to keep this family alive, and I’m really grateful for that.

My question is that can I really get rich if I educate myself and work for it??? Or is it just a pink dream??

I’m asking this question because medicine doesn’t pay the bills in my country. Doctors work in the hospitals for minimum wage. 140 usd a month for a family of 4 is impossible. Not to mention how badly they’re treated and how long they work. 

It’s just not worth it.

&#x200B;

I‘d rather be own boss and work on my own thing.   
I’ve started to learn copywriting and this opened up my eyes. I know that it’s going to super hard. 

I find that I have to study an insane amount of things. Even more than what I study in med school. 

Writing emails, sales pages, funnels, etc. Prospecting, and outreach. Sales, and marketing. Studying my market and my niche and knowing how to give a high quality service. 

It‘s way harder than medicine because it’s all on me. 

My goal is to gain enough experience as a freelancer in these things and then start turning it into a business like an agency for example, and get into the world of business from there.

I’m practically starting form nothing. All I have is my phone and tablet. 

Is this goal worth it?? Will business relieve my financial constraints and help me provide the best life possible for my family?? Or is it just a pink dream the online gurus sell to young men like me???

&#x200B;

If it’s the right thing to do, I’ll be more than thankful for any tips or advice.

For me keeping my community/customers engaged was always a challenge and we did gamification albeit manually and with a lot of headache. So we thought to ourselves maybe why not build the tools to do this? Any perspective on this area?

We decided on $5000 on pre-revenue and he paid me $2500 without any long and deep due diligence but then he disappeared for 15 days, and there was no contact, I tried to reach him numerous times during these 15 days but no response. Then he replied and asked me to work for him even during the acquisition.   


we decided on the cost and started work for him with one of my colleagues. I paid my colleague a good advance amount and did ask my client to pay me but he said he would pay soon because he didn't do any due diligence and pay me without any delay in the start. I trusted him and we started working. 

&#x200B;

The work was way way more than what was decided. And I didn't charge for most of the small gigs as a goodwill gesture. And then came a makeover of this product. So I again asked for the remaining $2500 which was the acquisition cost and then the remaining cost up till that date of work. Which was around $1200. So total pending up till now was $3700.   


Then he said he needed to show a demo to one of his clients. At that point, I got to know that he was upselling the product but it was not my concern. I needed the money which was due at the first place. Then he ghosted me again for 8 days and suddenly he paid the remaining $2500 of the original acquisition cost then the Christmas holidays came and he just disappeared again for 22 days. 

&#x200B;

And then when he approached me, his tone was different. We worked so much on the makeover that the designs kept on coming, nothing was decided, and there were no boundaries set to the project I was afraid to ask anything because I wanted to get paid, I was not working on anything else, its going to be my bread and butter for the past 2 months and next 2 months. One night there was a bug in the app and he threatened me that he would stop working with me if I didn't make things right within one night so I keep working all night.  


I was disturbed and nervous but then I decided to ask for my payments. He said that he already paid, I told him that was the acquisition cost and then he said okay, transfer the ownership to him and he will pay, I transferred the ownership of the GitHub repo and he ghosted me for 26 days. I kept asking about the progress etc but he didn't reply then one night the app was down and he came back to me. I told him to pay then I would work on it, he said just turn on the app and he would pay right away.   


And the same thing happened again, that SOB ghosted me again. Now he said there were some negligible bugs, and he knows that I can solve those but according to him he pays only when the app was bug free. I even told him to pay in installments but he said no, he will not pay anything. And then he texted to part ways because it is not working.   


But today I am launching that app again and decided never to sell it again and increase the MRR to 10K.

I believed these people got lots of visitors and definitely customers who pay. Stories I heard a long time ago made me think this was true.

**We launched on Product Hunt on 1st of September.**

The month before, we worked hard to get ready. We did hackathons to make our product better and prepared a lot.

We worked all day and night, got lots of votes, lots of visitors, and hoped a lot.

**And**  
**We won.**

We were mentioned in Product Hunt's newsletters,  
Got a lot of backlinks,  
And many people talked about us on social media.  
We spent thousands on AI,  
And hundreds of hours making improvements we thought were important

...

But, as time went by, no visitors turned into customers. Even worse, we couldn't get any feedback from users. At the same time The Product Hunt community is overkind, so we didn't get real feedback there as well We didn't know what to do next.

**Our hope from winning on Product Hunt wasn't real.**  
In fact we didn't get any customers who pay from that launch.

We got into a classical trap: People like to make things simple. We want success fast and try to find shortcuts. But there's no easy way, and it's hard to deal with these feelings.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Every product takes a long time to succeed, and founders change things many times to find the right path.

We did too.  
Two months after launching, we added the payment wall.  
We started getting customers, having today over 100 paying customers  
And we're still making changes.  
We still are not happy with the progress.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell):

> In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem.
 
After a few years of helping developers review code, I came up with 10 code smells and how to fix them while building my project [Axolo](https://axolo.co).

### 🧐 Refactoring Large or Complex Methods

Navigating through methods that sprawl across numerous lines or twist into complexity can be daunting. Simplification is key!

The fix? Employ a linter to enforce a maximum number of lines. Deconstruct these behemoths into smaller, more focused methods, each dedicated to a singular task.

### 🤔 Addressing Long Parameter Lists

A lot of parameters can muddle method signatures, making them prone to mistakes.

The fix? Consolidate related parameters into a single object. Adopt the ""parameter object"" pattern to streamline your functions, enhancing their readability and maintainability.

### 🙄 Minimizing Excessive Comments

An overload of comments often signals that the code isn't speaking for itself as clearly as it should.

The fix? Strive for code that explains itself through judicious naming and structure. Reduce reliance on comments, allowing the code's purpose and function to be immediately apparent.

### 🤦 Eliminating Duplicate Code

Repetitive code fragments are not just a nuisance; they complicate updates and can introduce inconsistencies.

The fix? Seek out and consolidate repetitive code segments into common functions. Adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle simplifies future maintenance and modifications.

### 😕 Harmonizing Inconsistent Naming Conventions

Naming chaos confounds understanding and introduces potential errors.

The fix? Commit to a unified naming convention. Names that are clear and consistent pave the way for code that's more approachable and decipherable.

### 😬 Enhancing Error Handling

Neglecting comprehensive error management can lead to erratic behavior and a codebase that's tough to sustain.

The fix? Embrace thorough error management. Logically log and manage exceptions to bolster the code's stability and dependability.

### 🤯 Simplifying Overused If/Else Constructs

An abundance of if/else branches can tangle code, making it challenging to read and adjust.

The fix? Lean on data structures or design patterns, such as polymorphism, to untangle complex logic, thereby enhancing the code's legibility and adaptability.

### 👎 Refining Inheritance Usage

Inappropriate reliance on inheritance can entangle code further, reducing its adaptability.

The fix? Verify that inheritance is used judiciously. Opt for composition over inheritance to achieve a code structure that's more flexible and straightforward to maintain. 

Be honest, which one do you usually see in your PR? If you think I'm missing something, let me know in the comments!",False,0.0128499999999999,The post is focused on software engineering best practices rather than seeking development services.

\- I already spent way too much time on features that are rarely used. Extremely hard to find the balance between quality and overengineering.

\- Marketing is overrated, if the product is good people will come. 

\- Multiple currency support is super important, received a lot of feedback about this.

The idea being I will fully take over their business in the next year as the original owner retires. There is to be no cost/financial gain per se to the owner, as I will be taking over their liabilities and covering them (insurance wise) for the next 12 years. That is the deal. I will however have to cover costs during the handover such as purchase of equipment, legal costs and the transition month where they pull their money out of the business and I’ll be liable for the overheads during the month of transition where costs are coming in, but I won’t yet have had a full month of work to invoice yet (if that makes sense).

Prior to takeover I’ll be joining the business as an equity director to get upto speed with their projects and get to know their clients for a period of ~6 months. I’ll be bringing in work during this time (currently equal to 25% of their current income). My question is how do we decide the share allocation during this period?

They have proposed two solutions:

1. When I join I get a % of shares based on the work I’m bringing in. My concern with this is there is then no flex for if I bring in more work.

2. They charge my existing company as if I were a client for the work their staff do on my jobs. My concern with that is that takes all the profit out of my work. I’m effectively giving them that work for “free”.

I’m sure there are other options. I just feel like neither are the right fit yet, but I can’t think of what would work best. They are good people and we are all working in good faith towards this goal. Would really appreciate suggestions, thank you all.

The concept has already been proven to work as there are a few businesses doing well at this. I just think they could be done better, smoother and with cleaner UIs.

I recently stopped working for a SaaS startup who was doing something similar but more complex and for a more specific industry. So I'm taking what I learned from there and using it to build my own platform.

Using a no-code platform might not work based on my research (please prove me wrong). I've done some Javasctipt coding before and believe that using React to build this platform will be the best way to do it (The startup I left also used React to build theirs)

With my very limited coding experience, I plan on building this platform focusing on the core features first before releasing it.

Without giving too much away, the main feature is based around a kanban board style of management.

I don't know all the available resources that could be used to build something like this and would appreciate any advice or information please.

*Background:* I have an [older version of PhotoSwipe working on my site](https://photo.2re.net/) but I am learning Vue and the old version uses jQuery and jQuery conflicts with Vue.

All I want to do at this point is to use the code on the [Getting Started](https://photoswipe.com/getting-started/) page to work so I can figure it out from there.

It says you need the Core, Ligthbox, and the CSS.

I linked the css in the head like it says so I don't think that's the issue. My guess is that I'm putting the JavaScript in the wrong place but I'm not sure.

I've tried putting the JS code in a script tag before the HTML code, after it, making a separate JS file and linking to it in the head, linking to `photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js` and `photoswipe/photoswipe.esm.js` in the head, but nothing seems to work. I thought maybe the there was some kind of configuration on my computer not allowing me to execute JavaScript locally or something, so I uploaded my different versions to a web server and it still didn't work.

Help! What's going on?

 `// Include Lightbox`   
`import PhotoSwipeLightbox from '/photoswipe/photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js';`

After my last launch on Product Hunt didn't get featured, I spent quite a bit of time reflecting and asking myself why it didn't make the cut. It was a bit disheartening, to be honest. However, Product Hunt recently shed some light on this very topic, sharing key reasons why products might not get the spotlight we hope for.

Here's a quick list they shared that I'm keeping for next time:

* It's gotta be a SaaS product, not something like a PDF.
* Don't forget to add a maker comment for engagement.
* Check your links; broken ones are a big no.
* Schedule your launch ahead of time.
* No repeats; make sure your launch is fresh.
* Big updates only, no minor tweaks.
* Be clear in your tagline about what your product does.

Given the limited screen size of mobile devices, it's essential to keep the interface uncluttered by minimizing the number of buttons, popups, and links.

Enter the sticky action button.

This engaging feature offers an easy way for website owners to increase conversions from mobile visitors.

**Benefits of using Sticky Action Buttons**

**1. Offers better engagement:** Sticky buttons are like sticky notes on your fridge that remind you to do something. Whether the user scrolls up or down the page, the sticky button is there to remind them to take a particular action.

**2. Higher quality conversions:** Studies have shown that in the last 15 years, the average attention span has dropped from 12 to 8 seconds. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that visitors who scroll through your website or spend more time than average on it are demonstrating a certain level of interest in what you have to offer.

Automate your sticky action button to appear when the visitor has either scrolled a certain percentage of the screen or spent an amount of time on the page. Presenting your call-to-action at the moment where the visitor has shown some certain level of commitment can improve conversions.

**3. Draw visitor's attention with animations:** We’re naturally drawn to movement, so an animated sticky action button is bound to draw a visitor's attention. The animation should be subtle, in a way to nudge the visitor to click the button, but not in an intrusive way that it becomes irritating.  This is one you’d have to test to find out what works best for your brand.

**Don’t take my word for it, here are examples of popular brands using Sticky action buttons as part of their conversion toolkit.**

1. Basecamp - $374.8M/yr
2. Riverside Fm - $30.3M/yr
3. Mfino - $1.42M/mo
4. Just Call - $1.6M/mo

## The product

ColdClicks is an AI based cold email personalization tool so naturally it made sense to use the tool to market itself.  The way it works is, you upload your leads, the tool researches each lead then uses AI to write the first line of your email.

This makes each email you send hyper-personalized, and relevant to the recipient, which significantly improves your reply rates. It also saves so much time compared to doing it manually.

We've been bullish on the idea of cold email being an incredible growth channel for bootstrapped startups for a while - it's very low cost yet highly scalable, so we decided to put our idea to the test.

## How we did it

First we identified our target market. There's a lot of ways we could've gone with this, but we started with lead generation agencies as these are the guys sending the most email, and an increasing reply rate will directly increase their bottom line.

We built a small, lead list targeting small lead gen agency owners based in the US. The contents of the email were very brief:

>Hey {{firstName}},  
>  
>{{personalization}}  
>  
>Reaching out because I noticed you're doing a lot of lead generation.  
>  
>We've built an AI tool that generates highly-personalized emails at scale to improve your reply rate.  
>  
>Would you be open to learning a bit more about this?

Of course, we used ColdClicks to personalize each lead based on their company website! Overall we got over a 21% reply rate, 6 trial sign-ups, and 1 paid conversion.

## Goals

As the internet is pushing against spray & pray models of outreach, with more platforms putting restrictions on high volume campaigns, it's important to make each email count. Personalized openers help significantly with this, they're the best way to grab the prospect's attention, and let them know the email is relevant to them and to keep reading.

* Most of the world sees Americans as rich, spoiled and completely unaware of what is going on in the world. And this is somewhat true.
* Hourly rate on Upwork and other freelance sites is highly inflated. To US buyers $20/hr may seem like a good deal but you are actually getting ripped-off. $20/hr is MORE than what Americans get paid for the same work in many parts of our own country.  

* Let me give you an example -  
$20 x 40 hours = $800.00 per week  
$3200.00 per month (post tax), this is salary for developers in many small towns of America, even today!
* So why are you paying foreigners who is low-skilled and has cost of living less than one-tenth of Americans?  
You are hiring a subpar ""freelance"" developer who doesn't really care about your work, works whenever he feels like & charges you 3x-4x  more than what Google pays their engineers in India. FACT!

**WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING HERE**

* Most workers on these freelance websites like Upwork, Freelancer etc are not good designers or developers. They are the leftovers, the people who were not good enough to be hired by local companies or international tech companies.
* Then there are these ""agencies"" run by code-pimps - a non-technical businessman, calling himself project manager. This guy hires non-english speaking developers for salaries that are even lower than local rates, exploiting them. There are many of them on Upwork, most from India, Pakistan, South America and Ukraine.  

* **MY SALARY AND COL DATA IS ACCURATE**
* I spoke to various reputed recruiters and companies who hire developers in India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, China and Ukraine.
* DO NOT trust the salary sites on the internet. Most salary data on these sites is crowdsourced and guess what happens when you crowdsource? Numbers get highly inflated by the coders themselves.  
**The problem is as Americans, everything we do is in English, open and available on the internet. But we know nothing about foreign lands. Especially third & forth world countries. Their local sites are in languages that we do not understand, so we are totally clueless to what actual wages are.**  
*The foreigners on sites like Upwork know our local salaries. But how do you find costs and salaries of the world?*
* Do you know the cost of decent lunch in Beijing? What about a nice rental apartment in Surat India or 10 mile taxi ride in Kiev or Caracas? You do not. And that's where you lose!
* Idiots will say I am talking like a privileged American. That I am not. I am a foreigner myself, who loves to travel, pay people well for what they are worth, so they live well WHERE THEY LIVE, based on their local wages.
* This post may get a lot of flack on a far-left website like Reddit. But everything in this post is factual.
* ***Freelancer sites like Upwork have created a culture of inflated hourly rates to boost their own company earnings. But guess who gets shafted, YOU, the buyer.*** The American small business owner. The entrepreneur.  
You will get screwed by workers in India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine or any of the South American countries. Period.
* I have compiled list of ACTUAL developer salaries from various countries. There will be many naysayers and folks who will say my numbers are wrong, but **THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY 100% ACCURATE REAL MONTHLY SALARIES OF AVERAGE PROGRAMMERS** in these countries. 
* Some may even throw words like ""slavery"" and ""racism"" , ""taking advantage of poor people"" ""being cheap"" etc etc. Those statements are invalid and does not negate facts.
* **Running a business is about being frugal and smart, being aware of what's going around you.**
* Cost of living in these countries is super low. Anyone disputing my factual data has an underlying devious motive.  
So here is the ACTUAL Developer salaries and COL data from various major cities around the world which took me months to collect, analyze and verify.

* **As Americans, it is hard for us to even imagine any salary below $10 per hour. But that is the case for most of the world outside of North America & Western Europe.** 
* The salaries for places I listed are NOT low, they afford perfectly decent living conditions locally.  

* So next time you hire a programmer, coder, developer for your project from Upwork or any third-world country through any platform, remember these people think you are foolish & that you are completely unaware of local wages. 

&#x200B;

* So how much will you pay for your next project, you American idiot? :)

I would like to get some insights or advices  on acquiring customers. The title says promotional marketing items industry, but it is a little broader, which later I will explain.


My mother is planning on opening her own business, where the main strength is her connections and ability to decrease the costs of projects by 30-40% when compared to local market.

She has approximately 15 years of experience of working with promotional marketing projects and things around, mainly for FMCG industry (think in terms shampoo stands in market where only products from Nivea are present, branded items for companies like hoodies, hats, powerbanks, brochures delivery and distribution to clients via mail in big quantities, etc.). The role of her company is mainly to be a supplier/middleman of things and services mentioned above. Currently for example she is managing inventory for online store of one of the clients, where she find the suppliers, introduce new items, etc.

Her clients were companies like Hyundai, Procter&Gamble, Heineken, and many similar in size, projects were sometimes on country level or global level.


But in all of the cases, the clients were coming to their company by themselves, or were acquired by different department, so my mom didn't had insights into that.



Now when it comes to starting the business, the something what I would like to hear some opinions about is marketing strategies.

First of all, she has Non-compete clause for 6 months (if she quits), which forbid her to reach out to current clients of her company, but that's fine, because the sizes of projects and required budget for payments are too big for starting. 
She would like to start from the beginning, to get traction, and when the finances will go well, focus on it fully.


First ideas how to start to get some traction and projects is:
*Public tenders (basing on historic data, she sees that she could easily outbid competitors)
*Reaching out by cold calling/emailing to local companies like hers in the industry asking for becoming sub supplier for some of the projects
*Targeted advertisement on LinkedIn towards profiles from sectors where the most clients are coming from in her current company


As the beginning, I think she should create the website with some study cases as examples, where visitors could see possibilities of cost savings thanks to her work.

If it useful, she is operating mainly for regions like BeNeLux/Europe. (As some stragies may be completely different for asia, etc)",False,0.01193,"The post discusses strategies for a promotional marketing items business, not a software startup."

For a bit of context, I am a propulsion engineer and have a comprehensive knowledge of jet engines, how they’re put together, and how they operate. 

What started as a passion project of designing (in CAD) my own jet engine has morphed into a business idea of producing and selling it as a DIY STEM kit. The plan is for it to come in a kit (miniature toolbox that I make via laser cutter), complete with colored instructions and education insights into theory of operation, how gearboxes work, the purpose of an adjustable exhaust nozzle, etc. 

My engine will be fully motorized with adjustable controls (w a digital RPM readout), interactive with removable parts, audio/visual effects, and a simulated afterburner (made with a fog machine, LED, and fan). It will be 3D printed but also uses real hardware, servos, magnets, electronics, etc. 

I am roughly halfway done designing/testing it and am hoping to complete it by this fall. I have no doubt that there is a community that would be interested in this, but I wanted some business advice, thoughts on how viable of an idea this is, and how I can shape this into a legitimate company. My jet engine is designed to be scalable and I have other ideas for jet engine models (turboprop engines, concept futuristic type engines, etc ). Also,  I plan on selling this online but I am open to other options and opportunities related to its STEM content.

However, seeing as they were sold to Squarespace, I recently found myself in need of a replacement. I did a bit of looking around and figured that I would share what I learned in case it's helpful to anyone else.

**Best domain registrars**

There were a few registrars that kept showing up more often than any others. They usually had glowing reviews, and few to no complaints. Here they are in approximate order of how commonly they were recommended:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)
- [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/)
- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)

One catch with Cloudflare is that you are locked into using their DNS.

**Dishonorable mention**

Most people recommended avoiding GoDaddy due to poor customer service and scummy business practices such as price hikes and buying up domains that people search for.

**Final thoughts**

Instead of looking on a registrar, you can use [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/en) to check domain availability.

Also sharing a tip that helped me in my last startup raise more than $3M.","To avoid possible post deletions, I'll share the list though the google form below.  
About the tip I've used to raise from VCs, it's pretty straigthforward but no one does it:

1. Visit the investor website.
2. Go through their portfolio companies.
3. Find founders that are in a similar industry as your company, or founders that you think would find your startup interesting.
4. Connect with founders through email or LinkedIn asking about their VC.
5. Ask for a 15min. video call, share your story and offer help.
6. If the chemistry is good, kindly ask for a warm intro to the investor.

Really, this is the way I found the lead investor for my biggest round! The amazing thing about this is that sometimes even the founder gets involved with you to see the best way to generate FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) with the investor. Yes, you'll get some mean ""No's"" along the way from stuck-up founders, but if you don't have a track record of a $100M exit, or your parents weren't VC's classmates in Standford, this is the best way to build a strong network.

Also, for the investor, having two different data sources saying you're speaking with many funds and founders helps a lot pushing them forward.

  
A last thing, I'm also building an AI tool to help with this entire process: 1) finding the best matches inside an even bigger database than the excel I'm sharing based on thesis, portfolio companies, and many data points, 2) Giving full contact information of all team members of the fund and their portfolio founders. If someone is interested too, please let me know!

To start this journey, I drew inspiration from various solopreneurs on Twitter, X, and through reading posts in this subreddit and Indiehackers blog.

## Inspiration

Throughout this journey, I encountered remarkable solopreneurs such as:

1. [Marc Louvin](https://twitter.com/marc_louvion) **(marketing, fast shipping, SEO)**
2. [John Rush](https://twitter.com/johnrushx) **(marketing, SEO, SaaS apps)**
3. [Dan Kulkov](https://twitter.com/DanKulkov) **(marketing)**
4. [Nico Jeannen](https://twitter.com/nico_jeannen) **(Facebook ads)**
5. [Philipp Keller](https://twitter.com/philkellr) **(SEO)**

Who were helpful enough to share their journey in public. Reading tweets from them started leaving impressions of ideas in my mind and thereby shaping my thinking to build apps in a better form. 

## Observation

Inspired by these solopreneurs, I learned and implemented their strategies. I realized they were part of a bigger picture – ideas for creating a profitable SaaS product. So, I decided to create a comprehensive guide called the **""Successful Solopreneur Guide""** to help others succeed in creating one.

## Organizing

I began bookmarking tweets, blog posts, and Reddit entries related to SaaS development and organizing them into sections like marketing, SEO, and branding.

## Solopreneur guide content structure 

The guide has three sections:

1. Marketing (20 to 30% complete)
2. SEO (basics covered + 1 approach to increase DA + 2 successful profiles)
3. Branding (10% completed)

Now I will mention what all is covered in each sections

2. [**SEO**](https://cookiewriter.com/successful-solopreneur/seo)
   1. Introduction to SEO, how is SEO done in the real world, and free tools to help in your SEO journey.
   2. SEO fundamental basics like what is DA, what is on-page SEO, and three important elements of on page SEO
   3. Running SEO on autopilot and how Wilson Wilson did it for Senja.io and grew its DA from 1 to 68 in a year
   4. Successful profiles
      1. John Rush's 7 Low Hanging SEO Fixes for busy Founders (Part 2)
      2. Philipp Keller's intro tweet on why backlinks are important

   1. Twitter/X growth strategy

The guide is a collection of important SaaS-related Twitter/X links with additional information added wherever necessary.

The aim of the [Successful Solopreneur guide](https://cookiewriter.com/successful-solopreneur) as mentioned earlier is to help as many people as possible with building a profitable SaaS with the experiences from successful solopreneurs all organised in one place.

USE the tools out there,"I’ve launched 3 SaaS websites in the past year and if there is one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you should never try to implement something that you could use a tool for instead

I’ve started with Brideabi where I did everything myself ([read more](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/s/wJslLWYNN0))
, continued with [TLPrinting](https://tlprinting.net) where I did a pretty decent job and finally [Vojo](https://vojo.app) where I absolutely nailed it!

The problem

As an engineer, it’s easy to fall in the trap of the desire to implement everything by yourself, especially if you haven’t built something yet (for example an invoicing module) or to be afraid of so many 3rd party dependencies.. and as an engineer, you would be right, but not as a startup founder!

You see, the problem is that implementing all these features takes a lot of time and they will certainly have issues that will increase the required time. When you are building a new SaaS, it’s important to get your product in front of your users as fast as possible to get feedback the soonest

And the worst part is, next time you will need something similar, you will very likely have a completely different tech stack and you won’t even be able to reuse your old code.

I agree that reducing the number of third party dependencies is important, but only after you have your PMF and you know it’s worth investing in the product in such a way

Some examples of what I did right and wrong.

1. In case of Brideabi I did everything myself. I’ve already talked about it on the link above so I’m not going to go into more details here

2. For [TLPrinting](https://tlprinting.net) I’ve done a lot better job. 
- For backend, I’ve used firebase. It also manages authentication so I’ve hit two birds with one bullet.
- For subscription management, I’m  completely relaying on Stripe, no need to store my users in my database when I can ask Stripe for the info.. well, for technical reasons, there would be, but again, in the first phase, it’s completely fine
- What I did do that good, is that I’ve build a messaging form with completely custom code.. and it has some major issues and limitations

3. In case of [Vojo](https://vojo.app) I’ve managed to raise this to an even higher level

- I’ve used Supabase as backend which from the perspective of this post is very similar to firebase but offers even more possibilities to have code in the backend (for free)
- For customer support I’ve used Brevo, it’s super easy to integrate and offers not only email marketing tools but also pop-up chat
- And of course stripe will be the source of truth for memberships but it’s not integrated yet

Conclusion

When launching a product, you need to forget about your engineering side and look for shortcuts. But don’t forget to always keep the door open for change if anything goes wrong!

After a year of me running it on the side while having a full time job, it was clear the best way forward was to sell for a variety of reasons. We decided hiring a new manager and scraping off the top wasn't logistically feasible. 

We spent \~6 months trying to find a private buyer but ultimately now have the business listed with a broker. There are several low but encouraging offers within the first week so it's looking like it will sell soon-ish. The deal being presented to potential buyers is a one-year leaseback to give us time to wind down operations, although a buyer could of course make an offer to take over sooner.

We currently have \~3-4 full time employees and 5-part time. They are all aware of the situation and the most critical employees are willing to stick it out since most of them have been with the company for \~30 years and are nearing retirement. We are of course hoping to give a generous severance (\~2 years) if at all possible. The family member who passed had little in retirement, so we have to be sure his spouse has plenty for retirement. 

Are there any words of wisdom or cautionary tales as we approach closer to selling? We have an accountant that will help, but should we look to hiring a business lawyer and/or financial advisor? Due to the death, there is a very important opportunity for the step-up in basis which we want to be sure is fully utilized to our advantage.

Ever wondered how foreigners and online platforms take advantage of small American businesses with foreign labor? I'm talking about things like why Upwork insists on hourly payments for freelancers, or what the real cost of living is in other countries, or even how much experienced software and web developers actually make abroad. And guess what? You, yes you, as an American entrepreneur, are getting the short end of the stick.  


**Here's a shocker: In third world countries like India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, Venezuela, Brazil, etc., workers don't get paid by the hour. So why the heck is there this culture of hourly wages for software developers online?**  


Before I dive into that, let's set the scene. Most freelancers are from places where the cost of living is dirt cheap compared to the U.S. And guess how ***Americans are seen? Rich, spoiled, and totally clueless about the world around them. Ouch, but kinda true.***

  
Now, brace yourself: The hourly rates on platforms like Upwork are massively inflated. Sure, $20/hr might seem like a steal to you, but in reality, you're getting ripped off. That $20/hr? That's more than what many Americans earn for the same gig in small towns across our own country.  
Let's do some math: $20 x 40 hours = $800 a week. That's $3200 a month after taxes – which is what developers in many small American towns make, even today!

  
So, why on earth are you shelling out big bucks to foreigners who are less skilled and live in places where the cost of living is a fraction of what it is in the U.S.? You're basically hiring a subpar ""freelance"" developer who couldn't care less about your project, works whenever they feel like it, and charges you 3x-4x more than what Google pays their engineers in India. Yep, that's a fact!  


Now, let's talk about what's really going down here. Most of the workers on platforms like Upwork and Freelancer? They're not exactly top-notch designers or developers. They're the rejects, the ones who couldn't land a job with local or international tech companies.  


And then there are these so-called ""agencies"" run by code-pimps – non-technical businessmen posing as project managers. They hire non-English speaking developers for peanuts, exploiting them to no end. You'll find heaps of them on Upwork, mostly from places like India, Pakistan, South America, and Ukraine.  


Oh, and in case you're wondering, my salary and cost of living data are spot on. I've spoken to tons of reputable recruiters and companies across India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, China, and Ukraine.  


Don't bother with those salary sites on the internet – most of that data is crowdsourced, and you know what happens then? The numbers get pumped up by these offshore coders themselves.  


**Here's the thing: As Americans, everything we do is in English and out there on the internet for all to see. But when it comes to foreign lands, we're clueless. Their local sites are in languages we don't understand, so we're totally in the dark about actual wages.**  


Critics might say I'm talking like a privileged American, but that's far from the truth. I'm a foreigner myself who loves to travel and believes in paying people what they're worth, so they can live well – based on their local wages.  


This post might ruffle some feathers on a far-left website like Reddit, but every word of it is fact. Freelancer sites like Upwork have created a culture of inflated hourly rates to line their own pockets. But who gets screwed over? You – the American small business owner, the entrepreneur.  


You'll be taken for a ride by workers in India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, or any South American country. Period.  


**I've painstakingly compiled a list of ACTUAL developer salaries from various countries. Sure, there'll be naysayers and folks who claim my numbers are off, but guess what? They're ABSOLUTELY 100% ACCURATE.**  


Some might throw around words like ""slavery,"" ""racism,"" ""taking advantage of poor people,"" or ""being cheap."" But those words mean diddly squat when faced with the facts.  


Running a business is all about being smart and frugal, and being aware of what's happening around you. And let me tell you, the cost of living in these countries is dirt cheap. Anyone arguing with my data has some ulterior motive.  


So, without further ado, here are the ACTUAL developer salaries and cost of living data from various major cities around the world. It took me months to gather, analyze, and verify this info. And just a heads up: most foreigners looking for work on these platforms fall into the Junior category.

So, next time you're scouting a programmer, coder, or developer for your project, whether it's on Upwork or some other platform from a third-world country, just remember – these folks think you're clueless about local wages.

I have good business acumen, you put me in any industry, I can build a profitable business. 

I'm a tech guy (CS engineering), Marketing guy (4 years ran my marketing agency), Sales guy (since 16 i've been selling), Finance guy (I have a great grip over capital markets). 

Now after trying a lot of things, I've got a great idea (I'll share whoever is interested) that I really think that can blitzscale crazily ($0 to $540M in revenue with $108M profits in 3 years). I have bootstrapped all my previous ventures, but now I feel like raising capital will give me a great edge and leverage. I cannot bootstrap because building a financial infrastructure requires capital upfront ($650k as angel round). 

Its been 2 years I've been trying to raise capital from VC's but got 70+ rejections, Micro VC firms but got 30+ rejections, then angel syndicate but got 20+ Rejections, my last route is super angels. 

If this doesn't work I seriously don't know wtd. I cannot take failures in life, I believe in Win big or go home. 2 Years of rejections hasn't even slightly made me feel depressed, but making no progress has. 

Upon that my GF broke up with me 3 months back, we were supposed to get married this year, but things fell apart. 

I the only reason I wanna win quick and big is so that I can retire my parents and give them their life back, they've sacrificed their 20's, 30's and 40's for my sake. 

I'm at the most lonely stages of my life, no friends, no GF (she was my emotional back bone, she was my go to person for everything), I cannot share with my parents, because I dont wanna stress them. 

I have a list of 50 big angels who're worth somewhere in between $500M to $1bn. 

If they reject, Killing myself is an option. I'm seriously done with so called life, I dont remember when was the last time, I felt happy, or smiled, or even laughed. My life is in shambles.

My question is to the ones who have made a comeback from this situation. 

Have you gone through this situation and if yes,

It has two types of mails:

1. It has a chat, and when you don’t answer for more than X minutes it will send you an automatic mail “hey, John sent you a new message”.

2. Same thing for orders, “Your receipt for Y”.

The first one should have a button unsubscribe at the bottom, since it’s not a required mail, but an optional one. 

I’m currently using Resend for the Type1 mails, together with a node.js server which scans all the chat rooms and detect if a message hasn’t been answered for more than X minutes.

I could obviously integrate a table on my Supabase DB, check if the user has unsubscribed and then don’t send the mail.

I would like to know if a better and faster solution to manage all the mail service exists, counting that I’m using next.js and i will probably integrate marketing emails in the future too (which requires an unsubscribe button too).

Their proposed solution is to just issue ""Estimates"" instead of ""Sales Orders"". The header of an Estimate can be customized to read ""Sales Order"", seems like no big deal. WRONG.

We've made the switch form QuickBooks desktop to QuickBooks online and we are finding that Estimates can't activate many of the functions required to run our business:

* You can't print packing slips from an estimate. You have to create an estimate, then create an invoice, then print the packing slip from the invoice. Sending invoices as sales order confirmations is a problem so we just have to create estimates (labeled as sales orders), then click back into QuickBooks to create an invoice immediately after, then print a packing slip. 
* Accurate ""Bundles"" pricing is reflected in Invoices, but not Estimates (Sales Orders). In QBO you can bundle products (great!). For example, we bundle freight cost with the product it matches so when you add that product freight is automatically applied. Freight per product varies by shipping zone so shipping product A to Zone 2 costs less than shipping product A to Zone 5. We have custom price rules to adjust freight cost according to Zone (great!). The problem is, price rules aren't calculated for bundles in an Estimate (Sales Order).  If I bring in a product+ shipping bundle, the base price for freight is demonstrated. The Estimate doesn't take into account price rules for shipping Zones of bundled items. The invoice does calculate the price rule for bundled shipping, thought. This means that the price of our Estimate (sales order) does not match the price of our invoices.

* Should I charge sales tax? If yes, should I add it to the invoice value (item+shipping) or will the invoice app deal with it? Or the total amount is low and I should not worry about sales tax?

I've been side hustling and starting and running my own businesses since I was 14. I want to talk about my most recent business venture and how much of a colossal failure it was.

Myself and my brother started a restaurant in the UK (2022), we used all our savings to purchase equipment, hire staff, and set up systems. A lot of heart dedication and money went into it. Despite our best efforts we failed, 8 months in we realized we wouldn't have enough money to continue and decided to cut our loses while we still could. It was devasting. All our hard work.

So why am I telling you this? It's because you need to know that failure is incredibly likely as business person. No matter how hard you try, how much money you might invest, and how good your plan is the chances of success are slim and a lot of this is **pure luck.**  We had a 20% chance at best at succeeding.

I'm currently in the process of developing a prototype for a tool that I believe could revolutionize the way we create user guides online. The concept is simple yet powerful: imagine being able to create comprehensive user guides for your website or application without any coding knowledge required.  
  
Here's how it works: I'm developing a Chrome extension that allows users to select elements on their website or application interface. Once selected, users can easily add content for each step of the guide via a simple popup interface. After completing the guide, the tool generates a JavaScript code. When this code is implemented on your website or application, the user guide starts running seamlessly, providing step-by-step instructions to your users.  
  
I believe this tool could greatly streamline the process of creating user guides, making it accessible to a wider audience who may not have coding skills but still need to provide clear instructions to their users.  
  
Before I dive deeper into development, I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this idea. Do you think it's something that could be useful? Are there any features or functionalities you'd like to see included? Any potential concerns or drawbacks that come to mind?

Our take is 5%, though our revenue is a little lower at $15k because we cut some deals with the first few suppliers. Plenty of room to grow regionally and nationally. The regional TAM is around $300 million, nationally it’s a $30 billion industry.

The company is me and my co-founder and 6 contracted engineers at an agency overseas. This is our third company my co-founder and I started together (1 failed, 1 gave us middle class incomes for 10 years but no exit). 

I’m not interested in being the CEO of a unicorn. I’m not interested in VCs. I don’t want to be in the cover of magazines, I don’t want to be a keynote speaker at a conference. I like starting businesses because I’m naturally curious, industrious, and I like problem solving and selling. My goal is to keep it geographically constained for now, dig deep not wide, bootstrap everything, and focus on sales and product. My engineers are excellent and we’re all working hard and well together. 

When I look for guidance on the path forward I mostly find start-up stages like pre-seed, series A/B/C, IPO, etc. I’m not interested in that path. I’d like to keep it small, no shareholders, bring it up to a few million ARR, and sell it one day. 

Neither do I want to make this all up on my own. Surely there are some entrepreneurs who came before me who walked this path in tech.

I’m looking for some advice regarding how best to invest some cash. I’ve recently started a web  services company and have had two small, successful website projects that have left me with $5,000 cash. Great start but they are pretty much one off projects without much hope of recurring revenue.

I’ve got a day job in IT management making around $150k but would like to transition to working for myself. I’ve got a crew of folks who are willing to work with me and can fill gaps on projects in areas I’m not great in such as sys admin, cloud architecture, business analysis, and database administration.

Before moving into management (and now on the side) I did full stack web dev. As such, I’ve done everything from fully custom enterprise apps to CRM projects to Wordpress landing pages to e-commerce sites. But I’ve mostly worked for other companies, hence why I’m a little less sure of what to do in this situation. One last bit of background, I can tolerate a bit of risk as I’m not the only income/insurance provider in my household but need to keep my job until I can do so without catastrophic financial impact.

A few questions for you all: 

- Should I be optimizing my business to serve e-commerce clients? This seems to be an area where there is a lot of potential goal for recurring revenue tied to overall sales of your customers.
- Should I use my “war chest” to start advertising my services?
-  What areas should I focus on providing services that have a high revenue yield?

I have been thinking about this for a while. We are not a huge company by any means but we have some distribution. We had done some market research but I figured here people would be the most honest.

Here is my idea:

We are planning to create a Roblox like platform for gambling, everyone will be able to create their own casino games through a simple game engine without coding and decide on assets, themes, odds and everything else our internal bot will test these games to make sure they have  a positive casino edge and then publish it on our casino network we will do a 50-50 revenue split with the creator.

My main concerns are:

a) casinos might be hesitant although we have proper licensing and with a couple of audits and a separate tab for these games (probably would need to pay extra or lower commissions for that) they would probably be ok.

b) players might be hesitant, casinos are all about trust but might be able to overcome this via some marketing magic.

The advantages would be:

a) People would be extremely eager to show their ""masterpiece"" to the friends, most of these creators, would at least initially, be gamblers themselves and likely to have a network of other gamblers thus we would have an incredible amounts of free marketing from these games.

b) Infinite possibilities and huge creative freedom, studios would are only likely to product what is already popular some of these people that are gambling themselves for very long times would know what the current issues are and address them with creative and efficient solutions.

Wdyt? It is an unusual idea but one that can be quite big if implemented correctly. Also, don't worry about the technical details we have a very talented team of engineers and we are profitable from our other games so we have plenty of time to create a solid product.

I want to see what options I have to bolt on a front-end with payment/user billing. I took a look around, the closest to what I am trying to do is the OpenAI billing page. 

Basically, I have a saas (python/django-based) with all backend processing, user access working correctly. Basically a user calls api to perform some action and each call costs an amount that is then deducted from the balance they have in the account. And when the balance is zero, the api call will fail with reason being ""not enough balance"" (something like that, you get the idea). 

I do have a user table (postgres) that has user info with their corresponding tokens and I have tested with api calling tools like insomnia/curl and everything works ok. Next phase is then to bolt on the front-end part for registration and billing. 

It is also possible there are other ways to do it that could be simpler and less problematic, perhaps, test with a simpler option before going full blown. I am open to ideas.

I have ADHD and one byproduct is that I’m very one or the other when it comes to things. Either extremely confident or unfaithful, extremely motivated or unmotivated.

Pair this with a habit of analysis paralysis. I am so obsessed that my idea will be a success, once all my dopamine gets burned out, I start thinking of all the cons, all the ways things could go downhill

This is the reason I’m scared,

For one this isn’t some high skill monopolized market. Anyone can do it and get fairly good as long as they have a couple thousand to spare.

That’d being said it’s a relatively uncommon business at least outside of the agricultural industry and into the general populace.

Like Tesla, everyone outside and in the industry knows about it, mushroom growing isn’t anywhere near as mainstream. Majority of the people who know about mushroom farming are mushroom farmers lol.

I see it as an industry that could be over saturated very easily and quickly which scares me but at the same time, it’s relatively underground so I see it as an opportunity to “buy low”

Secondly, my main customer demographic would be farmers market customer’s. What happens during the winter months when it gets cold? I can grow indoors so supply isn’t a problem but my customer demographic would shrink significantly. Would need to rely on restaurants and small grocery stores.

Html/css/js/php

I created a new website using an old website I made as a template. Essentially I copied the nav bar and footer and the scss/css files. I created a new homepage layout and created 4 more pages using the layout. Everything looks great using localhost. 

The problem: 

When I uploaded the site to the cloud vm the CSS is still of the old site. I just noticed the entire CSS file is the old file. Maybe that will help solve this. 

What I’ve tried/discovered:

Browser caches cleared. Chrome and Firefox look the same. Tried on mobile and another PC. Tried editing html stylesheet path from /style/style.css by removing the leading /. I had to change it back. I have verified the style.css.map includes the proper scss files. I have verified the CSS that is loading is not the same as the CSS that is on the server. I tried moving the old site from /var/www/html to another location. 

For example. The font family and color of the old navbar is completely different from the new, yet the old font and colors load. I just noticed the whole CSS is different also because everything is the old. 


Hoping someone can point me in the right direction. I’m no expert but I’m really lost on this one. 

Edit/update: I just adjusted the vhost file to ignore the old site vhost and only look at the new url. Went to the IP on the server and the new website is there looking great! It’s only the URL that is bugging out. I have a virtual host set up. I will try not using the vhost file next. So glad the error is stating to show itself.

-How can couples set a business up legally to protect their personal finances, particularly the finances of a spouse that is not legally involved? Things like setting up an LLC and avoiding sole proprietorship, putting pre/post nups in place, etc.

I want us to both be able to support each other’s dreams, but be informed and prepared in case he doesn’t find success, or worse.

######The other side of my question is communication-

-How do couples with a businessowner spouse manage hard discussions about finances and difficult times, particularly during the hard initial grinding years?

-What do couples where the spouse’s business failed wish they would have done differently in terms of communicating with each other?

-How can we set expectations and boundaries, and bake in time for each other along the way?

So I’m being groomed to inherit the family business. I’m mid 30’s, married with young kids. We are a small company that’s been around 25+ years and we have 16 employees. We are consulting firm in a niched software industry so our bread and butter are billable hours.

My background is mostly sales with some leadership positions being held at other employers. Leadership such as managing small teams and was managing 32 people at one point in time. I’m not an expert on the software but I’m learning and I can sell our services well.


I’m just tired. I’ve never managed a group of people before that have made my life this difficult. I’ve spent the last 1.5 years slowly stepping into my leadership role now. Bringing in some good, but hard change, taking steps to help mom and dad enjoy retirement while trying to grow the company. 

I’ve got a handful of people on my sales and marketing team, all of which are incredibly young and it’s hard leading these people. They expect the world to be handed to them, yet have zero responsibility or own up to their mistakes. But I’m quickly thrown in the frying pan when I make a small mistake. It’s slowly destroying me because I try very hard to be a human and a decent leader. I know I’m not perfect and I make mistakes, but everything that goes wrong is my fault. Nothing is ever their fault. It’s difficult for them to take any initiative, they mostly require very direct instructions. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at my wits end.

I understand I need to stop being a people pleaser and perhaps become more stern. But I don’t want our company to be like that. I don’t want to squeeze 150% out of my people to pad my parents pockets.

I think it’s time to bring in a trainer and provide some education. But the crazy part is, my consulting team runs itself. They have little to no issues. They work hard, are grateful, and go out of their way to help not only the company but anyone else.

I don’t know how to manage my time to lead these people, try to keep this company moving down the path we want, spend time with my wife and kids, and not go crazy.

Before anyone says, “everyone has an idea for an app, keep dreaming”……

This pitch for a successful application is not something I just came up with. it’s basically an evolution of my previous business which I closed down due to my mothers untimely death. My mental state impacted my ability to function and work, I still pay the bill for the 1-800 number that I still own and I also retain the patent and renew it when needed. At one point this 1-800 number business was bringing in about $200,000 a month gross earnings. it was a nationwide, phone number and service number. 

This was all about 10 years ago. I’m currently a successful business owner in Long Island and own about 10 laundromats. I’m looking into reviving this old profession, as I can see a vision of it, being way more useful now than it was before given the technology. 

I don’t want to dilute into much of what the application would be about. I only own the patent for the phone number and the service, but I do not own the idea of it being an application at this time.  

Before I go through with getting a patent on my name with my idea, I just want to know is it hard to get an application off the ground and be successful? I’m willing to invest about $800,000-$1 million into the company. But I know I probably will not be able to do it on my own and be as successful as Uber or something like that.

I have done a lot of searching but still want to ask my specific question. I'm very new to this and will consult a professional but am trying to figure out what I need to know and my questions for them.

I am a mental health therapist in Indiana and am planning to work part-time with a company that will pay me as a 1099, as a way to establish myself, with the goal of eventually moving to a more profitable PP. (Due to health insurance, etc. I will likely never be full-time in PP, so my income will remain on the lower side.) I've seen it recommended, but not required, to establish an LLC for business income/expenses. 

Additionally, I am a self-published fiction author. I just started making any money in 2023 and received it in a 1099. My research has said I don't need an LLC for this unless I make more money and/or publish other people's work, etc. I doubt I will ever make much in this venture, but I enjoy it. 

Further, I'm also a yoga teacher. Again, 1099 payments from a couple places I've taught, in small amounts. This will also remain low-income, however I would eventually like to get an additional (expensive) certification and combine yoga with my therapy work. That's a ways off, though.

I don't want to establish 3 separate LLCs due to the work required for each compared to the small income I will make from each (therapy will be the most, but still not a full-time income). I know the purpose of the LLC is to limit personal liability should I be sued in one of these avenues. I also know that this protection doesn't cover malpractice, which is the main reason I could possibly be sued in any of these areas (and I carry separate insurance for therapy and yoga). 

So, my question: Would it be a good idea to establish a general purpose LLC using, say, my name or something generic, then use DBAs for each venture? Or is that overkill at this point? (The application for an LLC in Indiana does not require an industry code, so it seems this would be OK based on my Googling...)

I am a YouTuber with a small but dedicated following (<5000 people) in a niche sport making money but not much. I am taking this year to try and grow my channel and other revenue streams. I expect to make money. I am also building a website / forum that initially will be for my followers to interact with me, but I would like it to eventually become the “go to” website / forum for this niche sport. I am also dropshipping merchandise via the website to my followers with the website logo and general other niche sport merch. I feel confident in the business plan. But I am very unclear on legal compliance with local, state, and federal regulations and how to structure these different aspects of the business. 

YouTube and the dropshipper send me 1099s. I also expect to make money doing lessons and promotions and similar influencer stuff. I am planning on beginning as a sole proprietor because the LLC cost in California is 800 dollars a year and I don’t want to shell that out until I’m actually making substantial money. I have very few assests to worry about liability, but I don’t want huge fines or legal issues.

Here’s an example using golf of why I’m confused:

My name is John Smith. My YouTube channel is named TheGolfer. My website is called TheGolfersClubhouse dot com. I sell merch through printify.TheGolfersClubhouse dot com. 

As a sole proprietor do I need multiple DBAs and business licenses? Do I need a business license at all? Do I need a DBA at all? If my YouTube name was John Smith, it seems like I wouldn’t need a DBA, but since I am “TheGolfer” I might need a DBA? Would the website and merch business fall under my DBA for The Golfer? Or would I have to get another DBA for the website since it’s not the same exact name for my YouTube as the website?  Do I need a sellers license for the merch even though they handle sales tax?

I know businesses can have multiple branches, but it seems like a YouTube, website, and teaching lessons might not all be covered by the same DBA unless I was just using my name, John Smith, on YouTube, John Smith dot com for the website, and giving lessons as John Smith Golf Instructor. 

Am I overthinking this, and does it even matter if most of my income currently is 1099s and only really operating online (aside from the lessons which I could do as John Smith)?

Please help. There’s plenty of general information on starting small businesses but this online stuff seems like the Wild West, and I have a feeling most people are just not complying.

user visits website >> enters sign up flow on website >> completes questionnaire and signs up >> can log into the app.

I need the information displayed in the app upon login to reflect what the user has already shared during sign up. The content is updated daily i.e. a module is unlocked as they progress or is unlocked for them depending on their skill level / answers.

When we first opened we had a very very petty business owner 15 minutes away that was publicly mad. We specialize in one of the many items he sells on his menu. (Ex our restaurant is donut heaven, he is dessert mania and he sells donuts, we only sell donuts- not the actual menu item but you get the point) 

It started off with him telling customers, leave us 5 stars and them 1 star and I’ll give you 5 bucks off. It worked and we got 3-4 1 star reviews. We found this out because he offered one of our customers the offer and they came and told us. 

We had a very public dispute on social media which ended up with some customers saying we were being unprofessional, and should just let it be. Honestly they are wrong, not to be arrogant, but am I supposed to just let this guy bully me? Whatever we stop calling them out and maintained a 4.9 star rating on Google so it’s okay. 

But this guy won’t stop. And the recent batch of reviews he’s been leaving have been personal. Mentioning family by name, claiming fraud, claiming we are unsafe for families. Crazy stuff. It’s been going on for a year.

I am currently a Senior Database Engineer working on a project for an issue I have seen come up time and time again with data roles. That is understanding the schema of the database and the connections of data flows. This is often the biggest hurdle when you join a new data team and takes the longest to wrap your head around since there are years of business nuances that must be understood before truly getting a grasp of a new data model.  
  
My educational background is in mathematics and economics at a university in the United States. I have spent most of my career working with data in one way or another. Before my data journey, I worked at a consulting firm focusing on helping F500 companies fill in specific fields in their quarterly and yearly reporting.  


**About the project:**  


The goal of this project is to create a closed-source software that data teams can use individually to get those insights on a table so they can be more familiar with the database they are working with. Moreover, gain better insights into the database so they can work with more confidence when they want to make changes. Which tables are the most important? What do all of these columns actually mean? What stored procedures/dbt models are the most important to grasp? This is something that sucks both for experienced members of a data team since until they understand this data teams are not comfortable letting them have more autonomy since they lack basic knowledge and sucks for the new/inexperienced members of the team because they may feel unconfident with making changes due to their lack of knowledge. Or even worse make a change and it is incorrect because they were lacking important information. Think making a change to a stored procedure/DBT model without understanding the downstream effects of these changes due to other stored procedures that use that table.  
  
The goal of this project is to create a closed-source software that data teams can use individually to get those insights on a table so they can be more familiar with the database they are working with. Moreover, gain better insights into the database so they can work with more confidence when they want to make changes.  
  
Most software on the market today is focused on either SQL development, database monitoring/tuning, or general DBA work. This would be less focused on these aspects and more focused on the structure of the database itself, although we could incorporate ideas from these applications into this one.  
  
**Technical stack:**  
  
I am most familiar with React and Python so I have been using that for testing. This will most likely be a desktop app so I do not believe I will need any cloud technologies. On the backend side, I feel confident in getting an MVP but would love a cofounder to work through the nuances of the project. Hence the post where I am looking for someone strong in front-end development to help me with this project.  
  
**Who I am looking for:**  
  
Nothing specific. I am not looking for a wizard or anything like that. Mostly looking for someone who I can connect and work well with. I have had this problem in the past and would rather fail this project with someone I can get the next one started with than someone who is a react god but can't work well with.",True,0.01615,The post is looking for a technical co-founder which aligns with the targeted audience.

a) Are Chinese freight forwarders worth it and what's their role in all of this? Prices seem similar to direct shipping from my manufacturer, so I don’t think I fully understand how they work.  
b) Is there a way to skip shipping to me and send the orders directly to customers, maybe through a distribution center (potentially in Europe)? My main market is EU, but I also ship some orders globally.

Basically what it's designed to do is to get user out of their comfort zone, create and attend events, connect with similar thinking people and explore new places.  
  
This idea came to me a year ago and it came to me because I was the one that wanted to get out of my comfort zone, because I was cooped up in my ball, just working, going to the gym and after that just watching TV and going to sleep. It was super boring and to be honest that life itself felt super depressing.  
  
I wanted to change something, started reading loads of blogs on how to liven up my life and it actually worked, I started doing some extreme stuff, random stuff, to just not sit on the sofa all day watching TV but to actually do something fun. That's when I decided that I could try to help others like me get out of their comfort zones.  
  
So basically I started making this app, it's been almost a year since I started developing and I actually already released the app. It's been in a Google Play market for almost 2 months now and I only have 100 users so far. Not gonna lie, it sucks to not get recognized by the work I've put in for almost a year.  
  
So my question is, maybe you guys have any ideas on how to get a higher user base? Maybe you have some comments about the app?  
  
You can find the app on google play store by searching Adventure Buddy or just by clicking the link below:

But almost all startups I hear about are focused on closing funding rounds and finding investment. This sounds concerning to me for two reasons:

1. I have chronic health issues that sometimes throw me off my game for a month or two - I even lost a job because of this at one point. Because of this, I am extremely risk-averse. I always try to avoid any long-term commitments that I cannot quickly get out of, pay for things upfront, and never take on any debt (not even mortgage - what if I lose another job and can't pay?) My whole being protests against the thought that someone may entrust me with a large sum of money and I will be liable if it goes to waste.
2. I have zero experience with running a business. If I hire a lawyer or an accountant or a marketing specialist, I have no way to tell if they are legitimate (I had at least one bad experience with this in the past). I feel like I simply don't have the necessary skills to smartly manage the kind of money on the order of hundreds of thousands.

I suppose I could try simply building everything myself, not have any commitments, and use some well-known accounting agency when I need to figure out my books and taxes.

Is this a viable way of building a SaaS business? If so, why almost 100% of founders that I hear about seek investment? Is it just to speed things up when you already have experience building a business?

I do I make this more profitable? I thought about 3 options when we have enough money on the side.

1) Move out to rent a bigger place.
2) Get another place and keep this one.
3) Rent a place just for the laboratory in order to free up space in the place we already have.

We are now pushing socials and we will do some special events about coffee and wine degustations.

Hey folks,

First: this is my first monorepo with pnpm and turbo.

I'm encountering a puzzling issue with turbo and pnpm and haven't been able to pinpoint the root cause. Here's my turbo configuration, which is fairly straightforward:

    {
      ""$schema"": ""https://turbo.build/schema.json"",
      ""globalDependencies"": [""**/.env.*local""],
      ""pipeline"": {
        ""build"": {
          ""dependsOn"": [""^build""],
          ""outputs"": [""build/**"", ""dist/**"", "".next/**"", ""!.next/cache/**""]
        },
        ""lint"": {
          ""dependsOn"": [""^lint""]
        },
        ""dev"": {
          ""cache"": false,
          ""persistent"": true
        }
      }
    }

My project structure is:

* `./apps/portal`: nextjs
* `./apps/gateway`: express+tsoa
* `./apps/api`: express+tsoa
* `./package/database`: prisma package

Upon a fresh clone of the repo, running `pnpm install` followed by `turbo build` works perfectly. However, if I run turbo build again without making any changes, the Next module is somehow removed from `node_modules\.pnpm\next@14.1.0_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0\node_modules\next`, causing the build to fail.

In order to make it build again I need:

1. kill turbo process
2. run `pnpm install --force --prefer-offline`

 I am running on Windows, with developer mode enabled to allow symlink.

* Turbo version: 1.12.5
* pnpm version: 8.15.4
* Next.js version: 14.1.0
* Node.js version: 20.9.0

I'm puzzled why the Next module is removed and why these steps are necessary to rebuild successfully. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or has insights into what might be causing this behavior? I'm looking for any configuration advice or troubleshooting steps that could help resolve this oddity.",False,0.01436,"The post is technical but focused on a specific coding issue, not on seeking a technical co-founder or development agency."

I am seeking an online credit card processor for my business via my website. The website is purely informational (medical office) but I want a way for patients to have a convenient way to pay invoices online.

Here's my ideal cc service:

* Patient visits website (eg [doctorsoffice.com/pay](https://doctorsoffice.com/pay)) and it takes them to a form to submit payment.
* The form has a few fields for informational / reference purposes (name, email, invoice number) and the amount they wish to pay
* Input cc info
* Ideally, I would love to tack-on the processing fees to the total, though this isn't a must.

I don't need the system to be able to pull-up invoices or anything. Manual input of the $ amount by the payor is fine.

Once complete, I would want the ability to download a CSV of all of the payments so that we can quickly reference them and reconcile to our invoices.

All the features seem attainable and simple enough that I have to imagine there are many services that would offer this seamlessly as a plug-in to the site.

Drop me a comment with a short explanation of what your startup does, and I will give you the name of the investor, a reasoning of why the investor can be a good fit, and the investor website.  
  
A bit of my background, I'm a startup founder that has raised several funding rounds. I know the pain in the ass that is to find through endless investor-lists enough investors to make a successful funding round, so I decided to build a tool to save time on this.  
  
For reference, here's an example of a startup description, so you know how much detail is needed:  
  
*Mercury startup example: Mercury offers banking for startups at any size or stage. With an intuitive product experience, founders can access free checking and savings accounts, debit and credit cards, domestic and venture debt, and more — and manage their business with confidence. Mercury also offers community programs that provide founders with the connections, advice, and resources to help them build the next great companies.*  
  
*Example match:*  
  
*Liquid 2 Ventures: Liquid 2 Ventures focuses on seed-stage investments, showing interest in financial solutions like Sequin's credit products. They can provide early-stage support and resources that are critical for a fintech business.*  
  
*Website:*  
  
*Clocktower: Clocktower Technology Ventures, with specific interests in the fintech sector including innovative platforms like Copper Banking, could offer specialized knowledge and partnership opportunities for a fintech startup.*  
  
*Website:*  
  
*MAGIC Fund: MAGIC Fund, being built by founders for founders, specializes in early-stage ventures and offers products essential for business growth, as seen in Brass and Float. This investor brings industry experience and a founder-friendly approach that could be instrumental to a financial startup.*

The other option is to use a browser wrapper - specifically Tauri 2 or Capacitor - with Svelte. However those naturally will only work with static Svelte, *not **Kit***.

Here is one thing I learnt.,"Over the past 4 years, I have been working on a web app that aims to help people diversify their reading by starting a mission to read the world. The idea is to read at least one book written by an author from each country in the world. The project started as a way for me to track my reading progress. I have been taking it slow, working on search engine optimisation (SEO), talking and listening to users, making updates and trying to build something useful. Over the years there were moments I got discouraged by the slow progress and almost gave up on the project. 

At one point, I abandoned the project and worked on other things for one year. So progress has been slow, but steady until a few days ago, out of the blue, I noticed a huge spike in the number of people visiting my site. I got more user registrations in one day than I normally get over a whole month. At first, I thought maybe Google had suddenly fallen in love with my website, but that wasn't it. To cut a long story short, it took me some time to realise that the sudden spike in traffic was the result of my site being recommended in one of the Morning Brew newsletters. I am not sure who I should thank for the mention, but I am grateful. I view this as confirmation that I am creating something that people want. Conversations with users have confirmed that.

What I am trying to say here is whatever you are working on, keep doing what you are doing and do not give up. **You will either succeed or fail and learn something**. You should be OK with both possibilities as long as you enjoy what you are doing regardless of the result.

I'm a Javascript dev with 10+ years of experience mainly working on the front end of websites and web apps but am looking to extend into full-stack territory by learning NodeJS.

To that end, as a learning experience I am building a web app from scratch using NodeJS, React, PostgreSQL and Prisma.  
I have my database designed, I have the models built in Prisma, I have my API's documented in insomnia. I have a basic Node app with a number of GET routes for accessing data in the database seeded by Prisma.  
So far so good.

What I'm working on next is authentication and this is where things start to get tricky.

What I have so far is a registration form that creates a user in the DB, and a login page that allows a user to log in and access the system.  
When a user logs in a JWT is created and an HTTP only cookie is created, when a user then attempts to access a route in my node app the cookie is sent with the request and the JWT is verified.  
When a user logs out the cookies is destroyed.

What I want to add next is a refresh token to go along side the access token and for a new refresh token to be issues whenever a new access token is created (so token rotation).  
What I can't seem to figure out is how to check a JWT to see if it is expired, obviously when you verify a JWT it will tell you it's expired but it seems tricky to actually be able to do anything with that information as at that point an error is generated.

So far all this is implemented without any 3rd party auth packages as I want to make sure I fully understand it and for me the best way to do that is to build it myself.

Any help and or pointers would be grateful.

Happy to answer any and all questions if more specific detail is required.

Looking back, what were the biggest pros and cons? 

I am relocating this summer for reasons unrelated to my own career. However, I’m looking for new career opportunities now because it’s unlikely that my current employer will allow me to work fully-remote. I’m considering all my options, but I think I want a change of pace. I’ve had a pretty diversified career journey so far - I’ve worked in hospitality, served in the military, and have been working in corporate finance for the past five years. Both times that I switched careers, I found that the skills and experiences I gained in my previous career(s) were highly valuable and allowed me to be successful very early on in my new career.

Working in corporate has been great. I learned a ton, led and developed effective teams, and made significant contributions. A major downside of working in such a big company is that my day-to-day is burdened with a lot of what I consider to be non-value added work: multiple layers of reviews before making decisions, resolving issues between affiliates, and just so much unecessary process. I’m wondering if I’d find more fulfillment working in a small business, presumably having much more breadth of responsibility but at a much smaller scale, and being able to make decisions much faster. I think I’d likely be taking a pretty big reduction in compensation, but hoping that the benefits outweigh this.

But TypeScript-wise, neither of those would work to make sure the store's value is defined in some other function. The other code in the component is reliant on the value being defined. I know those functions won't be called in the first place if the value isn't defined, but the compiler doesn't seem to. I still have to wrap every function's code with `if ($store.value)`.

I did not want the business and asked for a buyout but the partner refused and made me stay in a situation I didn’t want to be in. I got backed into a corner until I caved and bought it. 

Although the business is doing fine the mental gymnastics I have to do every day to feel ok going to work are leaving me feeling suicidal. Everyone kept telling me that if I didn’t buy the business the landlord would sue me for breaking the lease.

I don’t know what to do. I feel trapped and sad every single day. I’m glad to see my staff enjoying it - they are happy and making money but I am slowly drowning in my own thoughts. Yesterday, I stood by the subway and genuinely considered jumping in front of the train.

I have been making a version of this file for about 2 years, for new clients at my agency. Its kind of something I do to pass the time while waiting for access to their ad accounts.  


Now after making a few for redditors in exchange for testimonials (an arrangement I'm still open to), I have systematized my process, and turned it into a template and instruction manual.  


I have it gated elsewhere. I'm actually charging for it on my gumroad store, just to see if the template alone has that type of value.  


My goal is to offer these as a service for maybe a few hundred bucks, and eventually, work with my developer friend to automate the process, lower the price, and scale up the volume.  


For now, I'd love feedback on the template, and I'd love questions about what I do with these when I make them for my clients.  


The early feedback is that the value of this service could go way up with the addition of a ""reccomendations"" section. I see that as a possibility.   


I am also curious to hear what someone who follows my manual thinks of that as a product. I'm very interested in empowering businesses that are just starting and have low budgets. I know from when I was at a startup, we would have done the work ourselves to save the money.  


So here it is, the instruction manual has the template linked within. Also the resources I use are all linked in the instructions. Everything on there (right now) is free to use.

This job pays $2000 a week base plus $150 a day per diem, for overnight stays since they cover 12 states. So I started a llc to do this legally for tax purposes. Initially I opened a sofi account to keep my business money separate from my personal money but that turned into a nightmare. Sofi froze my account after the first deposit was made and has had it locked up since. So I have $4700 frozen in Sofi for the past 6 weeks. They froze it because the deposit had my name and the llc name on it and sofi doesn't do business accounts. I then opened a Lili business account and have been using that since. The reason why I wanted to use sofi was because I wanted the 4.6 apy to generate more money and for the physical checking for purchases. Lili doesn't offer either of these, no apy and no actual checks. Seeing as most of my interactions are with Amish, and they don't do wire transfers or accept debit, I really need access to physical checks in order to pay them. So I need some help trying to figure out how to set my Lili account to direct deposit into another account that has physical checks. I know I can just transfer the money to another bank but in order to get the perks of most banks then you need to have direct deposits made.

Apprentice-level Piano technician here, looking for some general advice from anyone who’s been in a similar place. There’s pro’s and con’s to running your own business versus working for someone, and I’d be interested if someone could weigh in on my predicament.

I’ve been working at a medium sized piano rebuilding shop for 6 years, and have accumulated lots of great skills like tuning, action rebuilding/regulating etc. 
In the past year I’ve been developing a side hustle with servicing piano’s in homes and schools, and it’s going great so far!
My day job at the shop is starting to feel like a lotus island. There are just enough things keeping me there– healthcare is provided, and I can just show up and work without doing any front-end/back-end business stuff. 
I’m making more per hour with my side hustle than at the shop, and I’m feeling frustrated with what’s available to me pay-wise at my day job. Love my job, and don’t mean to be shallow but I really just would like to be making way more money than I am now. 
I also have a feeling that a lot of tech’s would love to have the job that I have. It seems less intense than being a traveling tech. 
I have a feeling if I leave this position at the shop I work at, it won’t be available again in the future. Although I’m 27 without kids or a mortgage and I don’t want to settle if I don’t have to!

2. **Be honest about your following:** Never lie about your following. If you don't feel comfortable sharing that information, try to avoid the question, but always maintain honesty in your interactions.  
  
3. **Value is key:** Keep value as the main conversation topic when reaching out to collaborate. Explain how both content creators and their audiences can benefit from the collaboration. Highlight the mutual value exchange to encourage partnerships.  
  
4. **Don't be intimidated by subscriber count**: It's okay if the influencers you reach out to have a much larger following than you. Remember, the quality of subscribers also counts. For example, the first influencer I worked with had close to 70k followers on Instagram, while I had only hundreds. However, we managed to send each other almost the same amount of followers. Focus on the engagement and relevance of your audience rather than sheer numbers.  
  
5. **Build genuine relationships:** When reaching out to potential collaborators, focus on building genuine relationships rather than just seeking transactions. Invest time in getting to know the content creators and their work. Building trust and rapport can lead to more meaningful and long-lasting partnerships. I still talk with Alex from time to time.  
  
6. **Research audience compatibility:** Make sure your audiences are compatible!!! Ensuring compatibility between your audiences can lead to more successful collaborations and increased engagement with your content.

Could use some advice on where to go (more info inside).","I'm running a site built on Laravel. I already had a previous site set up on a different domain, and I was just using Gmail SMTP+app password for now because it was new and very low volume, and the welcome emails/password reset emails never had any issues delivering. I cloned the site for a new project, got a new domain, and again, Gmail SMTP had no issues. 

The moment I switched to Postmark, immediately the same emails were flagged as spam, despite me verifying with their support that my validation stuff (spf, dmarc, etc) were all set up properly. If the content of my emails was the problem, you'd think I would have had this problem before (I'm using the default Laravel email text as well, so I know it's not weird wording that would be causing it). I tried this with 3 other services (Resend, Sendgrid, and Mailgun) and I had the same spam issues with all of them. 

On all the flagged email I've received from all my tests, 100% of them have shown spf, dkim, and dmarc all as PASSED by gmail. https://i.imgur.com/eosKR30.jpeg

It gets more frustrating, because the aforementioned situation should lead me to believe that the content of the email isn't the problem, but whenever I send test emails via other methods (ones that send raw text with nothing else) these deliver successfully on all services. The other methods I'm referring to are:

> Mail::raw('Hello World!', function($msg) {$msg-to('testemailhere@gmail.com')-subject('Test Email'); });`

and 

> curl ""https://api.postmarkapp.com/email"" \  
  -X POST \  
  -H ""Accept: application/json"" \  
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \  
  -H ""X-Postmark-Server-Token: xxxxxxxx"" \  
  -d '{  
        ""From"": ""sender@example.org"",  
        ""To"": ""receiver@example.org"",  
        ""Subject"": ""Hello from Postmark"",  
        ""HtmlBody"": ""<strong>Hello</strong> dear Postmark user."",  
        ""MessageStream"": ""outbound""  
      }'  

Obviously the second one is only used with Postmark, but it delivers successfully when sent this way.

I've checked my domain and the the email contents on various spam checkers and nothing shows up as blacklisted or flagged/spammy, which makes sense because the emails work fine with sent through Gmail SMTP, and the raw emails also send fine through the test methods I mentioned. So it just makes no sense because no test gives me consistent results that help me pinpoint the problem. My domain is obviously not blacklisted/flagged because certain emails deliver fine, and the contents of the email are also not spammy or problematic, because they also deliver sometimes.

Anyone have any advice on where to go from here?

There is a pricing fundamentals side and a pricing tactics side. 

  
Here are four checks on the pricing tactics side I recommend to get started.

  
1) Is the upgrade path reason clear? The best pricing pages have a clear reason that you move between package A to B. It becomes muddled when there are 10 different features you get on the next package but the average customer only wants/uses 2 of those. This actually creates a psychology of loss (I am paying for stuff I don’t need). DocuSign does a good job of clear upgrade path. If I need something like Payments (a business critical need vs. nice-to-have) I know I need to move from Standard to Pro.  


  
2) Is the usage or payment metric clear? The best pricing pages make it clear that you are paying by usage, or contacts, or users. But there aren't 6 different factors that determine pricing. Gorgias does a good job here (pay by ticket volume) and then they have add-ons for the other bits.

  
3) Are the bundles simple? The best pricing pages have just a handful of line-items at the top that simply paint a picture of why you should get this plan. Slack does a good job of this (clean, simple bundles).

  
4) Are the personas clear? The best pricing pages allow you to quickly self-identify which package is right for you based on your niche, company stage or some other type of core requirement. SocialBee’s pricing page does a great job here (clear layout of best for solopreneurs, best for agencies etc.)",False,0.0127599999999999,"The post is focused on optimizing a pricing page for SaaS, not looking for technical co-founders or development services."

Hello everyone,

I'm in the process of opening a store and I'm looking for a payment processing solution that allows me to accept card payments. However, I've encountered a bit of a roadblock. The Square terminal requires either a Social Security Number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), and since I'm a foreigner, I don't have an ITIN and won't be getting one soon. I do have an Employer Identification Number (EIN), though.  
  
Another option I considered was Stripe, but I recently purchased the Square terminal and it needs to be programmed with code, which complicates things further.  
  
I'm reaching out to see if anyone has suggestions for alternative payment processing solutions that I could explore. If you have a business, what type of point-of-sale system do you use for processing payments? I've been considering Odoo as an option, but I'm also aware that Square has its own point-of-sale system, although I'm unable to use it due to the lack of an ITIN. Additionally, even if I opt for Odoo, they don't provide hardware, and I'm interested in having a cash register as well.  
  
I'd greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations on the best payment processing and point-of-sale systems, particularly for someone in my situation.

I have been using Ooma Office for years.  We are able to use (with a VOIP to analog converter) regular analog cordless or corded phones, transfer calls, etc.  I am able to go online and setup Ring Groups, and add cell phones as extensions, and transfer to cell phones, etc.  I can also have an extension setup in my home office, which works just like one of the office phones (again, an analog phone).

However, over the past year, it is obvious that Ooma no longer wants to support analog phones.  They are only offering VOIP (ethernet) phones services to new customers, and I can see features disappearing online which is starting to break our current system.  The VOIP cordless phones are very expensive.

Setting up a whole new Ooma Account under their new equipment, or moving over to Ring Central appears to be the best alternative.  They do offer analog converters, but I am not sure how functional they are.  In any event, I am guessing that cell phones with an app can be an extension and/or transferring to cell phones is an option.

Does anyone have any experience with Ring Central or another service provider that they can recommend (or warn about)?

I really would like to be able to use cordless phones in the office, even if it is just a spare cell phone with only a Wi-Fi connection.  And receive phone calls away from the office on my cell phone.  Being able to transfer calls is important.

Thanks in advance for all help.

Only 1 is on my actual plan, $15/month. So I could really say 1 paid user out of 500 signups, which is abysmal.

1bkjx14,,,,,,,,1711061163.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1bkjx14/splitting_up_my_partnership_advice/,"splitting up my partnership, advice?","Around three years ago, I launched my pressure washing business from scratch, pouring all my saved-up cash into it. I was really hustling, dropping flyers in neighborhoods, and following up on every potential lead. Alongside that, I started our company's Instagram and took care of all our branding, designing everything from our uniforms to promo materials using budget-friendly tools like Canva.

When the business began to grow, I roped in a classmate, ""T,"" because he had an SUV, which was way handier than my sedan. We decided to partner up, and incorporated with a 65/35 distribution although we later verbally agreed on 55/45. Not too long after, I found myself driving four hours to fetch a trailer, which I then had to assemble and figure out how to attach to my VW Jetta. It felt like my bank account was just bleeding money, especially since I was paying for most of our gear and fixing stuff myself.

But then things got tricky. T was all about moving our marketing online and picked out an agency. Things seemed okay at first, but we realized we needed to expand, so I secured a loan for a bigger trailer which i then built entirely by myself. My car overheated the first time pulling it so we found a car for the company.. i put up $5000 and T’s family put up the remaining $15k; we ended up putting it in his name and not the businesses because we didn’t want to pay for business auto insurance at the moment (business still pays over $650 a month for his insurance, mind you). Not very long after getting the new car T started treating it like a trash can, littering it with empty liquor bottles, vapes, beer cans, and trash, not to mention a massive sealant spill he never cleaned up.

The disrespect for our shared resources really got to me. I'd even made a spare key for the car, and T lost his and just took mine, showing no intention of returning it. His carelessness wasn't just annoying; it was downright disrespectful.

His trip to Brazil left me holding the fort alone over the holidays, highlighting our partnership's imbalance. The marketing mishaps continued too. T rehired the same lousy agency we'd ditched, then switched to another that couldn't even write a coherent ad. We were just throwing money away. I had to step in and redo our website and fix their ad messes, while T seemed oblivious to the issues.

I've been carrying the lion's share of the workload, from maintaining our equipment to fixing T's blunders. The lack of mutual respect and shared responsibility is glaring. I'm at a breaking point, seriously considering how to split things up fairly. I'm thinking I might keep the trailer and let T take the car, just trying to figure out a split that reflects our contributions without causing more drama. Overall, he’s a nice kid and I do really see him as a friend but he is just an atrocious business partner that just thinks everything is a joke; I need to find someone a lot more professional to continue a business with. It’s just a shame because he did put in a good amount of work at the beginning, hence why I agreed verbally to the 55/44 distribution.. it has only been downhill since then, though. 

EDIT:
one thing i completely forgot to mention but is one of his biggest issues is communication.. he’s not willing to communicate effectively at all, even after talking to him about it so many times.. he rarely answers my questions because he either doesn’t care to or thinks they’re dumb questions (i sometimes ask obvious questions because i like to be sure) or he’ll just pick and choose which questions to answer or ignore them entirely, instead asking his own question.. like for example i asked if ads had started and he just ignored the question.. i brought it up later as an example of his poor communication and he just said “you could’ve just checked the marketing group chat it said it in there, that questions already been answered”.. he also has a habit of just showing up to my house unannounced.. literally the DAY after i had a huge discussion with him about how i really can’t do this anymore and i’m about to dissolve the business bc of this lack of communication (among other things) he shows up to my house completely unannounced for a job i had no idea we had (he never ads anything to the schedule even after constantly begging him to.. always says he just forgot but that’s a whole other issue).. it’s like he just doesn’t care.. he just refuses to communicate and makes no sense when he does.. i’m also stuck fixing his grammar with clients as he is constantly asking me to proof read his horrendous grammar and spelling on texts to clients (4th grade level english, he’s all over the place)",False,0.01711,"The post discusses dissolving an existing physical business partnership, not seeking a technical co-founder or consultancy."

My responsibilities included placing orders with fabric manufacturers primarily in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, overseeing their shipping schedules, and finalizing payments after each shipment.

Whenever I had to make a payment to our partner manufacturers, I was required to open a Letter of Credit (L/C) at a local bank. L/Cs are commonly used in international trade, especially for large contracts, as they provide a trust mechanism between parties who typically do not know each other. By involving banks as intermediaries, trust is established through a third party.

For instance, as a producer, once you open an L/C at a bank, it acts as your counterparty, guaranteeing payment for your shipment regardless of what happens to the cargo or buyer. This payment is usually settled within 60 to 90 days. Your bank then coordinates with your buyer's local bank to collect the funds. Even in adverse events like a buyer defaulting, the bank can still recover some amount due to the L/C insurance.

However, L/Cs, despite facilitating international trade, are incredibly slow, often taking 90 days or longer to process payments. The bureaucracy involved in requesting an L/C is also cumbersome, involving extensive paperwork, strict banking hours, and the additional challenge of dealing with uncooperative bank staff.

Given today's global connectivity, where face-to-face meetings can easily be arranged in person or via Zoom, the necessity of L/Cs in every international trade transaction seems outdated. It raises the question of whether personal visits to partner factories or starting with smaller, test orders might be more effective ways to establish trust without the need for bank intermediaries.

My conviction is that trust in trade should be built directly between parties, rather than outsourced to third parties like banks or governments, whose reliability has increasingly come into question, especially after the covid pandemic.

This belief prompted my shift to the crypto industry. I saw #Bitcoin  as a revolutionary technology that could redefine trust when people recognize the value of self-reliance. In an era of diminished governmental and financial authority, individuals should have the freedom to invest, send money, and conduct transactions across borders with minimal regulatory constraints.

This is why I founded my business four years ago—to empower individuals worldwide to increase their wealth through technology and cryptocurrency, unbounded by geography or governing bodies. #Bitcoin  offers a vision of a world where anyone can engage in financial activities with anyone else, a cause worth dedicating myself to.",False,0.01478,"The post discusses building a business on Bitcoin for decentralization, not looking for a technical co-founder or consultancy."

They are difficult to deal with. I recently had an issue with my payroll where the account # was off and $8k didn't get paid. While we tried to figure out why, they fined me an additional $43,000. How $8k turns into $51k over an account # error seems like straight up robbery to me. Because of this I want to 1099 the couple guys I have. 

I normally pay around $20-$30 an hour, paid holidays, 2 weeks vacation, additional education and half the medical. Some exceptions to this but basic idea. 

There are also better tax benefits for independent contractors that I hope they take advantage of. 

What sounds like a fair pay increase to cover them being 1099?

Im thinking:

$2.5 unemployment compensation. 

$1 holiday & vacation. 

$10.5 medical

$1 misc

Total $15 additional an hr. 

So a $20 employee will be paid $35 and hr. I'd still pay for any additional schooling.

I searched for experiences with this, but the results are the reverse: Moving from WordPress to Sanity. That makes sense, as Sanity is pretty new and is built around that expectation. 

I asked the client why they were planning this move. They said they were pretty smitten with it when they started a few years ago, and they have grown with it. But they also see it as impeding their future growth and success. It's getting more complex to maintain, build new features, and train their non-technical staff to use them. Plus, not many are familiar with its unique quirks. Cost is also one more reason. 

Why WordPress specifically (and not Prismic or any other CMS)? WordPress is FOSS and has big community support, especially in their industry (Digital Publishing). That's good enough for them to build a solid base on for future growth. 

We have experience migrating from other old/proprietary CMS to WordPress, but this request is a bit surprising. Do you have any experience with it? Please share if you do.

If i make it a subscription based model, since it will be a online portal where users can log-in and see all the courses and videos, they can just go through everything in the first month and unsubscribe. I don't know what can be created/added monthly to be able to keep them in.

Obviously, hiring a full-time employee for this would not be reasonable for most small businesses. But paying $100 or $200 a month for someone to do it seems more manageable. My friends have said yes but those are only accounting for two small businesses and I want to gauge the interest on a wider scale.

\- Would an advisory board position be the best fit for this? Are there any other options that may be better?

That's what most of the marketing techniques seem to be about and it seems that all you need is to drive traffic to your site and then A/B test until you start seeing good conversion rates.

Unfortunately it's not enough.

You need to be driving the *right kind of traffic* to your site, which means people who are likely to need what you're selling *and* have the means and willingness to pay for it. A single visitor of the right kind is worth a thousand or even a million of the wrong kind.

That's why it's usually a good idea to find your first customers individually - one by one. That means understanding who they are, what they need, what market they are in, how they think about the problem, why they care, why don't they do it manually, why they don't hire an agency to do it, etc, etc.  
When you do find people like that, you realize a few things.

Your SaaS might be equally useful to Jim, a 54-year-old heavy equipment manufacturer from Arkansas and to Kelsea, a 23-year old wannabe TikTok fashion influencer brand owner from California (currently on a Yoga retreat in Bali). But you can't sell to both at the same time with the same message.

Your tech might be the same, but people in different markets will be thinking about things in very different ways, willing to pay different amounts, have radically different expectations, and use a *vastly* different language to describe their problems.

You've probably heard that it's a good idea to niche down. This is *why* you need to niche down. The niches really are very different and you can't expect people to just ""get it"" and buy your product. They usually don't.  
And one other point.

Niches are fractal. You think those heavy equipment manufacturers are a niche? They are not. They are a *market* \- a big one, with multiple niches, sub-niches, and sub-sub-niches. You won't know this until you dive in. You won't see it until you talk to people *in the niche*.

I was wondering if you would be able to give your thoughts on this.

I recently just finished 3 interview rounds with a start up company. I’ve been looking for about a year now and these rounds with this company went great!

My first round was with the COO. It went well. At the end of the interview he said something along the lines of “yeah I can see how this is a perfect fit.”  An hour later he sent me an email to set up the 2nd round.

The 2nd round of the interview was a panel interview with the CEO and Sales Manger.  Again, went great!  No more than 30 minutes later I get an email from the CEO setting me up for what seem to have been the final round with one of the investors in the company.

3rd round with the VC… went great! But then he makes a weird comment at the end “yeah it was great chatting with you, if we don’t go your way, I have your info and maybe we can be in touch” or something along the lines of that.  He then told me to follow up with whoever my point person has been on next steps as he didn’t know.  So naturally I followed up with the CEO and complete silence over the past 3 days.

Like it went from constant communication to total silence. 

This job is the perfect fit. It’s the same exact product I worked on from the ground floor at another company. The company and the product are basically the same from my previous employer. The role is almost the same.   Not to be egotistical but the company should know I’m the perfect fit too.

What are your thoughts here? Do you think I’m getting ghosted? Do you think they’ll reach out? I took out time over the past two weeks and answered every question they had. Did the assignment between rounds 1 and 2 that they game me. The least they can do is let me know where I am in the process or tell me they are moving on. Am o overreacting?

&#x200B;

I recently stumbled upon a fascinating tool that's been a game-changer for my LinkedIn engagement strategy, and I thought it might interest fellow web developers like you. Now, before you roll your eyes and dismiss this as just another sales pitch, hear me out.

&#x200B;

As web developers, we're all too familiar with the struggle of standing out in a crowded field. Networking on platforms like LinkedIn can feel like shouting into the void, hoping someone hears you. That's where tools like HyperClapper come in handy.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not here to sell you on HyperClapper or any other product. Instead, I want to share how leveraging AI-generated comments has helped me spark genuine conversations and drive engagement on my LinkedIn posts.

&#x200B;

Imagine this: You're sharing your latest web development project on LinkedIn, hoping to showcase your skills and attract potential clients. Instead of crickets, you receive a flurry of authentic comments from fellow developers, industry professionals, and potential clients. Sounds too good to be true, right?

&#x200B;

But here's the thing: It's not about the tool itself; it's about the strategy behind it. HyperClapper is just one example of the many tools available for streamlining your LinkedIn engagement strategy. Whether you're a freelance developer, agency owner, or aspiring entrepreneur, finding creative ways to stand out on LinkedIn can make all the difference.

&#x200B;

So, if you're looking to elevate your web development portfolio and expand your network on LinkedIn, consider exploring AI-powered engagement tools like HyperClapper. It's not about selling; it's about building genuine connections and showcasing your expertise in the digital landscape.

&#x200B;

I'd love to hear your thoughts on LinkedIn engagement strategies and how you're leveraging platforms like HyperClapper to enhance your online presence. Share your experiences and let's keep the conversation going!

While it's not mandatory for small business owners to hire an accountant, having one can offer several advantages. Accountants bring expertise in financial management, tax compliance, and strategic planning, which can help businesses thrive. However, the decision ultimately depends on the complexity of the business's financial needs, the owner's level of financial knowledge, and the resources available. Some businesses may find value in outsourcing accounting tasks, while others may opt for self-management or software solutions.

Hi. Via storyblok.com (or another headless cms or something? i was also thinking about using wordpress but idk) information about a product (text + images/videos) will be stored. 

I need to put the content somehow into a very simple website. 
The link of the website will be stored into a NFC tag. 

there are thousands of ways to do that. What’s the best/easiest way? 
Actually a wordpress website would be the best way i guess. but i dont really like wordpress that much, it is really slow…

any other CMS you can recommend? or with a head

do you know a cheaper alternative to storybloks? and a way to publish the content easy into a website? 

actually i’m a react dev but i didnt code for 2 years now and i need to get this done 

maybe i use a react boilerplate website where i fetch the headless CMS content? 

or maybe there is a SaaS for my “problem”?

video i would host on bunnycdn (cheapest option) or for free on yt

Hey SaaS Enthusiasts,  
I recently stumbled upon a game-changing tool that I believe could revolutionize the way we approach SaaS marketing on LinkedIn. Now, before you roll your eyes and dismiss this as just another sales pitch, hear me out.  
As SaaS professionals, we're constantly on the lookout for innovative ways to reach our target audience and drive engagement. And in today's digital age, LinkedIn has emerged as a powerhouse platform for connecting with potential clients and industry peers.  
Enter HyperClapper. I recently came across this tool, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for me. But first, let's clear the air: I'm not here to sell you on HyperClapper. I'm here to share my genuine excitement about how this tool has transformed my LinkedIn marketing strategy.  
So, what exactly is HyperClapper? It's an AI-powered tool that generates authentic comments for your LinkedIn posts, sparking genuine conversations and driving engagement. Whether you're sharing industry insights, product updates, or success stories, HyperClapper ensures your content gets the attention it deserves.  
But here's the kicker: HyperClapper isn't just about generating comments; it's about building meaningful connections with your audience. By leveraging AI to mimic human interaction, HyperClapper helps you foster genuine relationships with potential clients and industry influencers.  
Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Isn't this just another automation tool?"" Trust me, I had the same reservations at first. But after giving HyperClapper a try, I was blown away by the authenticity of the comments it generated and the impact it had on my LinkedIn engagement metrics.  
So, if you're looking to elevate your SaaS marketing game and make meaningful connections on LinkedIn, I highly recommend giving HyperClapper a try. It's not about selling; it's about building genuine relationships and showcasing the value of your SaaS solution to the world.  
I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences with LinkedIn marketing tools like HyperClapper. Have you tried it, or are you using any other strategies to drive engagement on LinkedIn? Share your insights and let's learn from each other's experiences!

- **Never interrupt customer sale:** Use email retargeting (5 emails for cart & checkout) and SMS bump (5 times) along with ads retargeting to maximize sales.
- **Never Skip Cart:** Avoid setting up skip cart automatically, especially when selling in European markets as it can significantly reduce conversions.
- **Niche Market Advantage:** Target smaller countries for bigger ROAS potential as there is a higher chance of success compared to testing products in larger markets.
- **Leverage Spy tools in Saturated markets:** Understand product trends in big countries and easily duplicate successful strategies in less saturated markets using spy tools like Google Trends and FB ads library.
- **Country Focus:** Concentrate on key countries with high potential such as Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland for significant returns.
- **Use related niche domains:** Use country-related domains and logos for dropshipping in niche countries to create a more localized and appealing online store.
- **Local Payment Methods:** Incorporate local payment methods in Europe like iDeal, Bancontact, Klarna, and Sofort to increase chances of success, as PayPal and credit cards may not be preferred in some countries.
- **Facebook Ads Mastery:** Keep Facebook ads simple, go broad, use no interest targeting, and focus on simple conversion campaigns to adapt to the changing dynamics of Facebook ads.
- **Revive winners on Facebook:** Duplicate successful products with slight variations and run separate campaigns targeting iOS and Android devices to maximize profits.
- **Aliexpress product images search:** Use Aliexpress product images search to find new variants and colors of successful products, as limited listings indicate a new and potentially profitable product.",False,0.01483,"Post is irrelevant because it focuses on strategies for dropshipping in EU markets, which does not align with the Ideal Customer Profile seeking software development or technical co-founder for a software/app idea.

\- Capture email addresses on my site  
\- Have an automated welcome series to engage leads  
\- Test and optimize emails.

  
My background is actually in marketing effectiveness analytics, so I know how important it is to optimize marketing content, subject lines etc. but the platforms offering those services are 'expensive' (for a bootstrapped start-up anyway).

  
I was thinking of using a cheap/ free service that offers customer segmentation and manually create test buckets that way. Its not like I have a huge email customer list anyway, so a whole A/B testing suite might be overkill.

Yes, you probably know more about your industry/sector than they do. Yes, you might have learned a few things that they don't yet know. But they know their craft/skill better than you (it's why you hired them right? RIGHT?) and they will know how to use it to make your product/service better.

It's OK to be supportive. But there's a difference between being helpful/responsive and interfering by becoming too meddling. If you insert yourself into every decision and every communication, you become Big Brother and your team will be afraid to make decisions and will stop trusting their own instincts -- the very things you hired them for. All that you get from that is more You-think and your startup won't grow and evolve.

- Generally having some visibility of my users so I have the ability to convert them. 

I know there are many individual solutions that cover these areas but I'm not sure if there's a one-stop shop? Moreover, is there any way to learn what approach I should be taking to convert users from the trial version to paid? I am not sure what approach would make the most impact in terms of sales, given a limited amount of resources I have to implement solutions. For example, I do have Google Analytics but can make little sense of the information and how to tie this in with an email campaign.

How have you approached this in the past? Would you recommend:

(1) DIY - using things like Logoai, canva etc. Time consuming but it's cheap and if you have an eye for design, end up with something good.

(2) Go through Fiverr etc to smash out a logo etc. But unsure of how they would then support future design requirements (e.g. illustrations, visualisation of complex topics etc).

I'm currently developing a survey/customer interview platform and would love your feedback. As someone who has used platforms such as SurveyMonkey to earn a little money on the side, I know how easy it is to BS your way through the forms. I'm not sure how companies gleaned any real value from my completed surveys, yet SurveyMonkey still exists and still makes money. 

Introducing my solution - another survey site! The competitive edge being twofold:

1) ""Surveys"" act more as customer/user interviews with follow-up questions generated in real-time. This allows businesses to expand the possible value for each survey beyond a fixed number of questions.

2) Survey responses by default are open to all customers reducing the cost for each business significantly. If private responses are a necessity, there is an option for that.

I am in the process of trying to get users of a free desktop app to upgrade to the paid version. 


Is there any known ways to perform an in-app upsell from free to paid? For example, is there a known period, day or method that increases the likelihood of the upsell succeeding? 

Some things I am thinking of:

- If the user is using the app for 7 days or more, a banner appears on start-up asking them to upgrade along with a 10% discount code. 
- The banner will block any app activity for say 30 seconds. 
- If the banner is ignored several times, then the user is prompted to at least share the link (Twitter, Facebook, etc) to continue using the app. 

The idea is to extract some sort of value out of the user so they can somehow support me. Of course, I don't want it to be overbearing nor the cause of anyone avoiding my app. However, I can understand why developers are forceful in trying to convert users as many will not do any act of showing support (financial or otherwise) unless they are pressured.

Any ideas?

I hope this is the right place to ask my question. I worked for a SaaS company for 3 years. I was very unhappy and quit to start my startup.

Because I know the domain and the market is big enough to get some share. I had signed a contract with this company and an NDA. The company didn’t give me either document. I don’t remember if either document has a statement like “You can not start a company in the same domain or work for a competitor.”. I don’t want to contact the company and ask for the documents. I talked to a friend who quited from the HR department of the company. He said that there is no problem to work for a competitor or start a similar company. What do you think about this? Is there any risk for me to start a company in the same field and create a similar product?

Thank you in advance.

  - **Landing Pages**:
    - Standalone webpages designed for specific marketing campaign objectives.
    - Optimized to convert visitors into leads or customers by encouraging a particular action.
- **Content**:
  - **Bridge Pages**:
    - Often contain content that provides additional information, context, and persuasion related to the advertised offer.
    - May include reviews, testimonials, comparisons, and explanations to help visitors understand the value proposition.
  - **Landing Pages**:
    - Focus on a single call-to-action tailored to drive conversions.
    - Usually contain concise and compelling content related to a specific offer or campaign.
- **Design**:
  - **Bridge Pages**:
    - May have a simpler design compared to landing pages with the primary goal of transitioning visitors smoothly to the final destination.
    - Maintain consistency with ad terms, branding, and messaging.
  - **Landing Pages**:
    - Often visually appealing and structured with a clear hierarchy of information and prominent placement of the call-to-action.
    - Design elements are optimized to enhance user experience and encourage conversion.
- **SEO Considerations**:
  - **Bridge Pages**:
    - Sometimes used in paid advertising campaigns and may not be optimized for SEO.
    - Focused on converting paid traffic rather than ranking organically in search engine results.
  - **Landing Pages**:
    - Optimized for SEO to capture organic traffic and may target specific keywords related to the campaign offer to attract visitors from search engines.
- **Examples**:
  - **Bridge Page Example**:
    - Imagine clicking on an ad for a weight loss supplement.
    - Instead of directly sending you to the product page, the ad leads to a bridge page that discusses the benefits of the supplement, shares success stories of previous users, and offers a discount code.
    - After reading the information, you are prompted to click a button to proceed to the product page.
  - **Landing Page Example**:
    - Suppose a company is running a webinar on digital marketing tactics.

I’m building my fashion rental startup (our own inventory + peer to peer) in a place where fashion rental as a concept is non existent. 

I’m facing a challenge when it comes to insuring my inventory is handled properly by renters, and preparing for loss and theft cases. 

Unfortunately, Stripe is not available here, so capturing funds after the item is returned is not an option. 

Currently, the system we have in place (we haven’t started operating yet) is charging the renter about 15% of the item’s retail price for 3 day rentals, and once the item is back undamaged, this insurance fee is returned. 

However, that doesn’t help in the case of excess damage, loss or theft if the renter simply refuses to pay. 

We are working on an ID verification system do that in those cases, we can resort to legal escalation.

I’m just wondering if we’re missing something and if there might be another solution to this challenge?

With significant interest (70k+ waitlist signups) from the wider community, we're preparing to scale our platform through an AI-driven approach. Here’s what we have so far:

- Proven Track Record: Successful cohorts, student success stories, and rapidly growing interest from the community.
- Scalable Platform: Our AI-driven platform offers personalized mentorship and training at scale.
- Market Opportunity: High demand for internships, mentorship, and career guidance, which our platform addresses.

As we consider scaling, we’re currently evaluating two options: begin charging students for our platform or secure funding first. While we’ve found that students and their parents are willing to pay, we believe that obtaining funding could help us build a full-time team and invest in marketing campaigns to reach more students effectively. 

What do you think is the best strategy for our platform's growth? Your insights and advice on which path to pursue would be invaluable in helping us tackle the pressing challenges of student unemployment and the skills gap.

Our product is more than just a project management tool; it embodies our vision for the future of work.

* In recent years, there's been much talk about how close we are to being replaced by artificial intelligence. While AI has made strides in facial recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processes, it still falls short in areas requiring creativity and innovation—qualities that define human value.
* Developers, with their insatiable curiosity and technical skills, are at the forefront of the intelligence revolution. As AI technology evolves, developers will need smarter tools to enhance their capabilities.

This is where our product comes in.

We have launched a research and development management platform mainly for developers, but also for project managers, product managers, and developer leaders.

And get to market fast.   
I am a full stack web developer, meaning I can take care of all things tech (frontend, backend, cloud infrastructure). As long as you take care of all things sales and ops, committed, and motivated to make your project a success, we will have a fruitful relationship.  
No, I’m not FAANG. But I did work for some F500 companies as a freelance developer, as well as successful startsups in many diferent areas (regulationtech, edtech, healthtec, proptech and so on) and I know how to build an app with a state-of-the-art tech stack that is bug-free, secure (so it doesn’t get hacked) and will scale to any levels of traffic.  
Don’t reach out unless:  
\- you already have UI/UX designs ready or at least a wireframe  
\- you want me to to start building the app “tomorrow”, and consequently you want to get selling ASAP - not next week, next month, or next quarter. You want to start selling NOW.  
\- You want to move fast and “break things”  
If you have the above, send me a chat request with:  
\- A brief description of your background, what you are trying to build, and why this will be a profitable SaaS. This is your pitch, so take your time - only based on this I will decide to whether get back to you or not, I know a winner when I see one. The more niche the idea the better  
\- A link to your LinkedIn profile if you have one (not a problem if u don’t)  
\- You have a UI/UX designs ready, or at least a wireframe.  I can deal with ambiguity well and won’t get bogged down in details. Figure things out as we go, right? But you do need to have something already sketched out that I can build the app against… If you want to spend hours and hours on discussing what’s the best feature to add to the MVP, and what’s important and what’s not, get on. As you are the owner of the idea, you have the domain expertise, and you are supposed to be confident in it - you know what users want. I can only feedback on UI and UX considerations, and I won’t do on anything else. You are supposed to iterate based on feedback from real-world users anyway.  
B2B or B2C apps are both fine  
About me:  
\- I have 7 years of professional experience building web apps. 2 years as an employee, the rest as a consultant/freelancer working for many different businesses, teams, enterprises, and startups, through well-known global recruitment agencies and some not so well-known ones. I’m top rated on Upwork for whatever its worth, it’s a decent ref in addition to my resume.  
\- I had been out of work for quite a long time due to a very difficult tech job market. I’m here to build something that will make money relatively soon once released. With someone who will match the skills, effort, talent and potential that I have.   
\- I want to build a product and get paid with someone who is very motivated. If you move meetings, contemplate things, not willing to work hard, can’t make decisions confidently and fast, or don’t really care, or expect things to take of themselves, please move on. If you have a full-time job, that’s fine, cuz something needs to pay the bills. Some jobs are really not that hard and have time to do other things (like working on a startup). Also, I noticed some founders want to have “fun” and focus on finding a partner who are a “great fit”, which is naive and arrogant, in that order (how can you tell someone is a good fit? based on your gut feeling? Gut feelings are wrong all the time, and all the good ones are already taken anyway). So no I can’t guarantee those things. And actually no one else can even after 10 meetings, and a beer together. Things go wrong all the time. But I’m reasonable and motivated to work things out. And you can’t ask for more.  
\- As above, I’m not here to waste time chit-chatting, contemplating life together or making friends (fine if it happens). But that’s not what I focus on. Please move on if you are not a serious cofounder.  
So rather than waiting for my next gig to come in (which who knows when its going to happen) I decided to take a leap of faith and work for my self. But I want to do what I can do best - development, and not sales - I will let you do that.

* Asset integration (say goodbye to hosting on Azure Blob, S3, and the like)

It's especially hard because a job board is a two-sided marketplace. You need extreme adoption from the job seeker side to make it appealing for employers to use your site. That's why I always work extra hard to make ends meet at MoAIJobs.

MoAIJobs is a job board for AI professionals to find work in AI easily. I started this project as a fun 2-hour challenge on Twitter last December. The project quickly got picked up in multiple newsletters including Ben's Bites, and Robert Scoble shared the project on his Twitter account. So, I worked on improving the site further.

However, I figured out that the site needs more visibility to make it useful for both parties involved: job seekers and employers. Job seekers need more jobs on the site and employers need more job seekers on the site.

I can cold reach employers to get them post on my site. But the engineer inside me is not a big fan of this idea. He hates this marketer thing. And he thinks the superior thing to do is actually making the employer wanting to post on my site. For that, he knows we need extreme adoption. Engineering as marketing is his preference.

So, I began to think of some useful and novel side tool ideas for MoAIJobs.

I came up with two ideas initially.

The first one is ""WILL AI REPLACE ME"" - a tool that predicts when AI will replace you based on your resume. 

Link: [https://www.moaijobs.com/tools/will-ai-replace-me](https://www.moaijobs.com/tools/will-ai-replace-me)

I quickly launched it on Product Hunt.

For the first few hours, there was nothing. So I went offline to have a chill time. But when I came back online there was the surprise. 

Product Hunt tweeted my product on their Twitter account and then sent me a message saying it's a great app, and they even followed me. It's surreal. Thousands of product geeks found my app intriguing and started testing it.

One little marketing trick I did was giving the option to download the results as an image and share them across social media. Hundreds of users shared their results on Twitter. So, it was a nice PLG.

The product then got picked up on multiple sites and LinkedIn.

The second idea is ""AI job application reviewer"". In the near future, AI is going to screen all resumes, so I thought something like this would be extremely useful for job seekers to understand how AI tools perceive their resumes. 

Link: [https://x.com/NithurM/status/1770129528137859386?s=20](https://x.com/NithurM/status/1770129528137859386?s=20)

This tool got quote retweeted by u/levelsio (founder of NomadList), he has around 400k followers on his Twitter account. So, the app got some wild traffic. Hundreds of job seekers evaluated their job applications with this tool.

All of this combined to 7k unique visitors to my site in 3 days. And I got a ton of new email signups as well. So, overall the results are not bad. And I feel like I am just getting started, there is more work to do. Just wanted to document this here with you all. Hope you learn something useful from this.

It's especially hard because a job board is a two-sided marketplace. You need extreme adoption from the job seeker side to make it appealing for employers to use your site. That's why I always work extra hard to make ends meet at MoAIJobs.

MoAIJobs is a job board for AI professionals to find work in AI easily. I started this project as a fun 2-hour challenge on Twitter last December. The project quickly got picked up in multiple newsletters including Ben's Bites, and Robert Scoble shared the project on his Twitter account. So, I worked on improving the site further.

However, I figured out that the site needs more visibility to make it useful for both parties involved: job seekers and employers. Job seekers need more jobs on the site and employers need more job seekers on the site.

I can cold reach employers to get them post on my site. But the engineer inside me is not a big fan of this idea. He hates this marketer thing. And he thinks the superior thing to do is actually making the employer wanting to post on my site. For that, he knows we need extreme adoption. Engineering as marketing is his preference.

So, I began to think of some useful and novel side tool ideas for MoAIJobs.

I came up with two ideas initially.

The first one is ""WILL AI REPLACE ME"" - a tool that predicts when AI will replace you based on your resume.

Link: [https://www.moaijobs.com/tools/will-ai-replace-me](https://www.moaijobs.com/tools/will-ai-replace-me)

I quickly launched it on Product Hunt.

For the first few hours, there was nothing. So I went offline to have a chill time. But when I came back online there was the surprise.

Product Hunt tweeted my product on their Twitter account and then sent me a message saying it's a great app, and they even followed me. It's surreal. Thousands of product geeks found my app intriguing and started testing it.

One little marketing trick I did was giving the option to download the results as an image and share them across social media. Hundreds of users shared their results on Twitter. So, it was a nice PLG.

The product then got picked up on multiple sites and LinkedIn.

The second idea is ""AI job application reviewer"". In the near future, AI is going to screen all resumes, so I thought something like this would be extremely useful for job seekers to understand how AI tools perceive their resumes.

Link: [https://x.com/NithurM/status/1770129528137859386?s=20](https://x.com/NithurM/status/1770129528137859386?s=20)

This tool got quote retweeted by Levelsio (founder of NomadList), who has around 400k followers on his Twitter account. So, the app got some wild traffic. Hundreds of job seekers evaluated their job applications with this tool.

All of this combined to 7k unique visitors to my site in 3 days. And I got a ton of new email signups as well. So, overall the results are not bad. And I feel like I am just getting started, there is more work to do. Just wanted to document this here with you all. Hope you learn something useful from this.

I build my products in public on Twitter, so if you want to learn and grow together, please make sure to follow.

I made my first ever post here yesterday asking to roast your cold emails since I send 100K cold emails per month across 10 clients and we are beating the market by more than 50% in terms of positive reply ratio. 

Some of you were happy to send over examples so I can give my feedback.

But many of you roasted me in the comments saying that I spam people and that cold email doesn't work. 

I took the time to read your comments to see why you guys were hating so much. 

It's become very clear to me that most of you unfortunately just have had a bad experience with cold email, and that's **FINE.**

but let me try to change your mind...

The barrier to entry for cold email is so low, so naturally a lot of noobs and bad players enter the space and ruin the reputation of it.

BUT

That means that to be GOOD at cold email has never been easier because the contrast is so big. 

# BAD COLD EMAILS THAT YOU GUYS HATE

* They often start with ""I hope this finds you well"". 🤮
* They often talk about themselves. 📢
* The email is not relevant to you at all ( that shows little to no research was done) ❌
* The email is way too long 🤥
* The cold emailer ( is that a thing) asks yo for a meeting even though this is the first time you've heard of them 👎🏼
* They follow-up with you 10 times and keep asking you if you saw their last email ( so beg haha) 😭

# GOOD COLD EMAILS ( HOW WE DO IT) 

* We start our first lines with an observation about YOU. 👍🏻
* We run automations that scrapes relevant information about you to make sure we only reach out to people who WANT to hear from us ( or from our clients) 🧠
* Our emails are never more than 100 words. ( that's already a lot tbh, we try to aim for 60-70) 📗
* We **NEVER** ask for a meeting, we know that a lead needs around 7 touch points before they book a meeting with us. ❌
* We **ALWAYS** end our email with a soft call to action and a lead magnet. Essentially leaving the ball in their court. 🏀
* We only send two emails. Then we take a break for 15 business days ( 3 weeks) and send another two. If we don't get a reply, we move on to the next. We only retarget those people 2 quarters down the line to see if the timing is better🕧
* We do this \^ because we know that only 3 percent of the market is ever ready to buy. 💰

# HARSH REALITY 

is that most business operate using cold email.   


For those of you hating, I would recommend keeping an open mind and realize that you just had a bad experience with cold email.

I will also say that cold email isn't the silver bullet.   


At our agency we double down on content ( duh look at me right now), we run cold emails, we leverage our network for referrals, and set-up partnerships as well. 

Cold email is just ONE channel, but god damn it does it have a lot of pros once you have i figured out. 

# BUT WAIT, HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS LEGIT

Fair enough, I could be talking out of my ass, so I started compiling the best positive replies we have gotten. I plan on adding more and more by the day, but you can start by having a look [here](https://gamma.app/docs/Look-at-the-positive-emails-you-could-be-getting-v3w716539ct8o81).

I'm stuck between using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Fine-Tuning a pre-trained model. I would appreciate insights from anyone who has experience with these techniques.  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG combines the power of pre-trained language models with a retrieval system to enhance the model's ability to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers. It retrieves documents related to the input query and then generates responses based on both the input and the retrieved documents. Has anyone here used RAG in their projects? What were the challenges and benefits you observed?  
Fine-Tuning: Alternatively, fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a specific dataset allows it to adapt to the nuances of that data, potentially providing more precise outputs tailored to our application's needs.

I am here to share an in-depth look at Frontly.ai, a no-code platform that has significantly impacted my approach to app development. While I'm not officially affiliated with Frontly.ai, I do have a referral code that benefits me if you choose to use it.My aim is to provide a genuine, tech-savvy analysis of its capabilities and how it might serve your projects. Also, a quick heads-up: English isn't my first language, and it's been a while since I've used it extensively, so please bear with any quirks in my writing.

**About me**

Though I'm not affiliated with Frontly.ai, having a referral code means I get some benefits if you decide to explore the platform using it. This arrangement, however, doesn't color my views on the platform's utility and efficiency.

**Core Features & Integration**

Frontly.ai’s simplicity in linking with Google Sheets for data management and enabling CRUD operations has been a game-changer for me. Its array of customizable blocks caters to a variety of app development needs, offering a level of personalization that I've found invaluable.

**User Experience & Security**

What stands out to me is Frontly.ai's intuitive user interface and comprehensive security measures, making the app development process both user-friendly and secure. It's impressive how they balanced ease of use with such robust security features.

**Automation & Custom Action**

The ability to create custom actions within Frontly.ai has opened up new ways for automating workflows and enhancing the functionality of the apps I've built. It's a feature that underscores the platform's versatility and power.**Limitations to Consider**Though my experiences with Frontly.ai has been largely positive, it's fair to acknowledge some limitations, like its dependency on Google Sheets, which might not suit every project's scale or complexity.

This growth highlights the demand for platforms like Frontly.ai, which streamline the creation of custom internal tools, thereby enhancing business efficiency and productivity.**Why I'm Writing This**I believe in the power of no-code platforms like Frontly.ai to democratize app development, making it accessible to more people.

1bqof7a,,,,,,,,1711716403.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1bqof7a/turning_a_social_media_agency_into_15_million_in/,Turning a Social Media Agency into $1.5 Million in Revenue,"Steffie here from [Founder Folks](https://www.founderfolks.com) with a recent interview I did with Jason Yormark from Socialistics. Here is his story how he started and grew his social media agency.


**Name:** Jason Yormark
**Company:** Socialistics
**Employee Size:** 10
**Revenue:** $1,500,000/year
**Year Founded:** 2018
**Website:** [www.socialistics.com](https://www.socialistics.com) 
**Technology Tools:** ClickUp, Slack, KumoSpace, Google Workspace, Shift, Zapier, Klayvio, Zoom, Gusto, Calendly, Pipedrive



**Introduction**
I am the founder of Socialistics (www.socialistics.com), a leading social media agency that helps businesses turn their social media efforts into real measurable results. I am a 20+ year marketing veteran whose prior work has included launching and managing social media efforts for Microsoft Advertising, Office for Mac, the Air Force, and Habitat for Humanity. I have been recognized as a top B2B social media influencer and thought leader on multiple lists and publications including Forbes, ranking #30 on their 2012 list. I've recently published the book Anti-Agency: A Realistic Path to a $1,000,000 Business, and host the Anti Agency podcast where I share stories of doing business differently. 

You can learn more about me at www.jasonyormark.com.



**The Inspiration To Become An Entrepreneur**
I’ve been involved with social media marketing since 2007, and have pretty much carved my career out of that. It was a natural progression for me to transition into starting a social media agency.



**From Idea to Reality**
For me realistically, I had to side hustle something long enough to build it up to a point that I could take the leap and risks going full time on my own. For these reasons, I built the company and brand on the side putting out content regularly, and taking on side hustle projects to build out my portfolio and reputation. This went on for about 18 months at which point I had reached the breaking point of my frustrations of working for someone else, and felt I was ready to take the leap since I had the wheels in motion.

While balancing a full-time job, I made sure not to overdo it. My main focus was on building out the website/brand and putting out content regularly to gain some traction and work towards some search visibility. I only took on 1-2 clients at a time to make sure I could still meet their needs while balancing a full time job.



**Attracting Customers**
Initially I tapped into my existing network to get my first few clients. Then it was a mix of trade shows, networking events, and throwing a bit of money at paid directories and paid media. 

This is really a long game. You have to plant seeds over time with people and nurture those relationships over time. A combination of being helpful, likable and a good resource for folks will position you to make asks in the future. If people respect and like you, it makes it much easier to approach for opportunities when the time comes.



**Overcoming Challenges in Starting the Business**
Plenty. Learning when to say no, only hiring the very best, and ultimately the realization that owning a marketing agency is going to have hills and valleys no matter what you do. 

**Costs and Revenue**
My largest expense by FAR is personnel, comprising between 50-60% of the business’ expenses, and justifiably so. It’s a people business. Our revenue doubled from the years 2018 through 2021, and we’ve seen between 10-20% growth year over year.



**A Day in the Life**
I’ve successfully removed myself from the day to day of the business and that’s by design. I have a tremendous team, and a rock start Director of Operations who runs the agency day to day. It frees me up to pursue other opportunities, and to mentor, speak and write more. It also allows me to evangelize the book I wrote detailing my journey to a $1M business titled: Anti-Agency: A Realistic Path To A $1,000,000 Business (www.antiagencybook.com). 



**Staying Ahead in a Changing Landscape**
You really have to stay on top of technology trends. AI is a huge impact on marketing these days, so making sure we are up to speed on that, and not abusing it or relying on it too much. You also have to embrace that technology and not hide the fact that it’s used. Non-marketers still don’t and can’t do the work regardless of how much AI can help, so we just need to be transparent and smart on how we integrate it, but the fact is, technology will never replace creativity. As an agency, it’s imperative that we operationally allow our account managers to have bandwidth to be creative for clients all the time. It’s how we keep clients and buck the trend of companies changing agencies every year or two.



**The Vision for Socialistics**
Continuing to evolve to cater to our clients through learning, education, and staying on top of the latest tools and technologies. Attracting bigger and more exciting clients, and providing life changing employment opportunities.

The business simply handles automated backups of your databases, protecting you from disasters like accidental deletions or server shutdowns. The business is currently on sale for $700,000.  


I took a look at the business and wrote some notes about how I’d run it if I was able to purchase it (haha).  


# The Problem:

Everyone from agencies and startups, to large companies heavily invests in data operations. For many companies, their data is the moat that sets them apart from the competition. Building database systems is already a difficult task. But the task becomes even more burdensome when you realize that you have to deal with database backups. This prevents founders, and engineers from focusing on building and solving bigger problems since their time is taken up by managing the database system and its backups.  


This is where a business like this can step in, and manage the boring work for you.  


# Product: 

The product effectively saves users the time and headache of going through all the technical steps of setting up a database backup system. I think this is the biggest pain point it solves. This allows engineers, startup founders, and agencies, to focus on delivering results, instead of being concerned with complicated tasks like database backups.  


This also brings me to another point - the product should be as easy as possible to use. Implementation should be a seamless experience for engineering teams, allowing them to set it and forget it.  


A big advantage of buying a business is the customer base it comes with. In this case, you are acquiring a business with 2,000+ developers, agencies, and startups that are:  
a. Heavily invested in their database infrastructure.  
b. Looking for ways to save time in building and managing their database infrastructure.  


This is a great opportunity to introduce and upsell new product features within the existing platform.  


Here’s some I came up with:  
a. A managed database service. This would go one step further and handle end-to-end management of the database infrastructure. This would be particularly useful for smaller businesses without a dedicated technical team.  
b. Database monitoring and alerts. This would be a way to monitor real-time performance issues, unusual activity, etc.  
c. Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS). This would go one step further than a database recovery system, and offer a comprehensive disaster recovery service. This ensures businesses can continue operations with minimal downtime.  


# Marketing:

This is a B2B business, so this makes marketing a bit more difficult.   


I think the best way to reach potential customers is using something like [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com), which is a tool that lets you find companies based on their data stack. I would filter down for companies using technologies like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc. You can then reach out to this company’s CTO (or highest level technical position) and pitch them on the time and headache they would save the team by implementing this solution.  


# Challenges: 

Developers often have a mindset of “I can just build it myself”, so it is notoriously difficult to sell to technical people.   


The listing also mentions that revenue growth is down 11% from last year. I’m not 100% sure what the reason is, but IMO this shouldn’t be a big deal. The listing mentions that the founders are selling to pursue bigger opportunities, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the business has just been neglected a little bit.  


# Is It A Good Buy:

Yes, I think so. While the price point is a bit too high at $700,000 (3.6x revenue & 4.6x profit), some characteristics still make this a strong purchase.  


Firstly, the company has been in business for 9 years. This is an extremely strong track record for a company of this size, proving this is here to stay.  


The company is also in a great industry, B2B SaaS dealing with data. This means it isn’t just some consumer fad that will fade out, but a legitimate solution that businesses have and will continue to use.  


The business has also seen months where it made almost double its usual revenue, at $30,000 per month. These spikes are a good sign that there is plenty of room to grow, even at this size.

I started a company with my technical co-founder a little while ago. We were automating content creation and our most viable product was wrapping ChatGPT with prompting to make a seamless integration with your Twitter account (I.e. no more copy and paste). We have absolutely struggled to get anyone to use the platform and although a ton of people who I beg to try the platform out have feedback, it’s almost always “if you had 100 more features I’d use the product for free.” 

Our goal is to automate 99% of the hassle to get your company on Social Media. The video editing, the image editing, thinking up posts… it can largely be automated. But we are so far from that end result that it’s going to cost a fortune in time & money to get it off the ground.

And pre revenue, we’re not looking for investors. 

So we made a pivot to Social Media Management where we will handle a company’s social media for them for $999.99/mo. Our promises will be very straightforward and clear. 

As we build our clientele, we automate the process more and more until our client base is scalable and our platform goes from Service to SAAS.

Hello all.  
I'm a technical cofounder at a funded startup. We've been going at it for a few years now. Probability for a exit in the next couple years are low, but I think the company can survive and continue to grow with a possible exit in 5-6 years.  
However, I don't enjoy this anymore, and I am burned out. The prospect of continuing for years is not appealing. Long hours, constantly shifting deadlines and requirements, ever growing duties, cofounder personality conflicts, almost total destruction of my social life, low compensation (my market value outside of the company is around double my current income), and growing financial needs at home, have me considering leaving the company.  
It would be a major blow to them short-term while they scramble to replace me, and might hinder short term fundraising efforts--which can become catastrophic if the fundraising climate doesn't improve.  
How do I handle this without destroying my reputation? Suck it up and continue? Demand increased compensation? Just leave with ample notice? Try to see through another fundraising round and see where we are then?  
Any advice welcome.

To do that, I offer 10 leads every 2 weeks for free to 30 handpicked people from the comments. If I pick you, you'll receive via email 10 leads twice per month based on your preferences (industry, company size, total funds, country etc).

To participate, I need to know what kind of service your company is offering and if you already have paying customers as social proof. Please comment this down below. I only want quality B2B SaaS companies to reach out to my leads because obviously, the goal is to get a deal between you and the prospects.

I see this as a win-win for the SaaS community here. You'll receive leads with the potential to close deals, increase sales and I get to validate my database of leads.

\---

Why this may be interesting for you as a B2B SaaS owner? The leads are companies who just got funded and have money available to spend. These prospects are likely exploring outsourcing opportunities, presenting a valuable opening for you to engage and present your services effectively.

To prevent spam, the first participants to join will receive access to the leads first. Simple as that. If you find yourself in second place or beyond on the list, there will be a brief delay of 1-2 weeks before you gain access to contact your received leads.

Why am I doing this for free? Again, I want to validate if my database of leads are of quality. I can only do that by offering people my leads and let them reach out. 

You may ask yourself ""*if everyone is getting these leads, won't this be a problem?*""   
No. I am limiting the amount of spots so the leads won't be spammed. Also, I don't recommend you to email the prospects too often. If you don't receive a response from the prospect: move on.

I've been playing around with the voice enabled AI human like conversations which is finally good enough to be used in production applications.

I decided to focus on the candidate phone screen, which is the first step in just about every companies hiring process before selecting candidates to introduce to the team for interviews.

These phone screens are time intensive even though a very small percent of candidates are actually qualified and worth introing to the team. There's also a lot of time spent sifting through resumes, and in my experience many of these resumes don't get reviewed at all which results in potentially great candidates slipping through the cracks.

[PhoneScreen.ai](https://PhoneScreen.ai) aims to eliminate sifting through resumes by allowing anyone who wants to apply to have a short 10-15 minute phone screen with an AI that asks questions to gauge how well the candidate is qualified for the specific role. 

AI is very well suited to coming up with interview questions based on a provided job listing and now with the voice improvements able to conduct a 2 person conversation very naturally.

Using [PhoneScreen.AI](https://PhoneScreen.AI) will save companies up to 60 hours for every 10 open roles they are hiring for, plus allow them to source even more candidates that would have been lost in the resume shuffle in the traditional process.

My experience was (and please let me know if you have a different experience with recruiters), but:  


* Yes, they have their fees which are significant but they get you talent fast.
* The employee attrition through recruiters was lower than through internal hiring.
* Skill-fit was similar or higher with talents sent over through recruiting agencies.

With internally lead hires I had the following issues:

* To many communication cycles in the team and with the potential candidate
* To much hassle with the initial screening, since everyone applies for positions which are tangentially relevant.
* Not enough talent leads in a reasonable time frame.

I have the feeling that a lot of startups and SMBs are suffering due to waiting times for critical roles and that there is a feeling of reluctance to hire a recruiting agency for some reason.

For reference, I run a solo bootstrapped 11k MRR SaaS.

I've been building my business for some time now. It's been a a lot of hard work, a lot more luck, and a nonstop learning experience. I taught myself the whole modern web development stack (JavaScript, Vue, Firebase, TypeScript...) on top of everything else it takes to run a small business.

Right now, it's very successful, and my users are really happy. That's awesome, but it comes with massive platform risk. The future of this business is uncertain, which has led to some reflection.

The biggest takeaway is this: no matter what happens, the skills and knowledge I've gained are mine forever.  That sense of growth and capability is incredibly empowering.

But here's the most surprising, meaningful part:

My son is 8, and he watched me for a year as I built this thing on nights and weekends. He would sit next to me at night in bed while I hacked away at my laptop. He would get great joy when I would forget a closing quote and VSCode would suddenly report 13 errors. Eventually he asked if he could try coding.

I created a little boilerplate project for him, and explained how each part of the page was like a lego block. If you put them together, you have a whole ""app"". We sat together while he worked through reproducing a little sample site for him, and he got a lot of joy out of seeing it come to life. We leaned on Github Copilot a lot - the tab autocompletion really lowered the barrier of entry for someone who is a really slow typer. I don't know what AI will do to the coding profession in the long term, but it's magical teaching someone to code like this.

He created a site that is about his interests, with a Gemini chatbot he could talk to.

I'm sharing this because I never imagined starting my SaaS would spark something so wonderful in my son.  I'm still figuring out the business side, but this experience feels priceless.

For reference, here's the tech stack I used to make it simple for him:

* Vue 3, Vite, and Quasar, with Typescript and the Composition API
* Tailwind styled Quasar components using UnoCSS
* Auto-imports of Vue imports and Quasar components
* Gemini AI Chat using a Firebase extension
* Github action to automatically deploy to Firebase via CI/CD

I'm not going to advertise my business, but I told him I would post his site for people to see.

Company has a handful of front end/back end building the MVP, a college marketing intern, and a grant writer who is actively applying for grants.

We are ready to raise a pre-seed round to put towards the MVP and create more runway.

We are pre-revenue but have 20+ interested and hot leads (from our MD and RN contacts) we are talking to. 2 yes' so far but haven't started with them yet due to timing of their EMR situations. Lot's of interest but aren't ready for an actual sale until this summer. Plan is to Beta with first 5-10 clients.  Each client is projected to be $50K-$300K annual revenue once operational for what we do (we serve hospitals). Pro-forma is as accurate as we can project based on our SWOT but of course we all know this is wild speculation pre-revenue.

How would you suggest we take on pre-seed? Right now I am looking to raise $200K to give us an 8 month runway for the tech infrastructure and PM needs for the first clients. We are lean, tight nit, and work efficient together. We have recruited top US based tech talent with our network that is working at night to help us build. 

Attorney says to do a SAFE round with a 10-20% savings.

Should I do this or a convertible debt instrument? Biz loan? Get a pre-evaluation and sell shares?

Also, what would a new founder not think of in this situation that you want to caution me on?

What is really helping us stand out is that because we have a MD and RN and a US based tech team, our AI isn't going wildly inaccurate. We are training the model with 30+ years of the best medicine brains and the engineers are people who use our healthcare system so there isn't foreign talent with no knowledge of what this ""should"" look like writing the code.

Relationships: I have been dating and meeting women actively. This takes up 20-25% of time of my week.  
  
Self Work: I meditate every alternate day as a habit, journal weekly, read books as much as I can and listen to podcasts. I go to meetups, social events to network actively and maintain a social life so that I dont lose my mind.

I (43 M), have a wife, no kids. Currently having solid income from my day job as software engineer, no savings. Some may say I should have had savings. Sorry, I'm trying to fix my life by realizing it now. Please hear me out below.

I helped a lot of business on the side as engineering lead, but I have never quit a job and start a new biz without income.  I have a family to feed (I do have some monthly savings now, but that was also being used doing a house remodeling). I have bootstrapped a product on the side, launching soon. I still have my day job. My wife hopes me to stay with day job.

\- When I struggled a two/tripple job life (day job + side project), get the production up and running, people tell me ""You are not act as a CEO, you are thinking as CTO""

\- I was told ""You are solo entrepreneur, that'd be a downside""  
\- I was told ""Your major problem is that you are not full-time""

\- I need tractions to show the market validations, I don't have a solid series entrepreneur track records, I don't have a MIT/stanford alumni network

There are more that I can't remember now. I by heart agree with everyone! I just got the stress of being pulled into so many conflicting directions.   
At the same time, I honestly think that'd be what an CEO/founder have to deal with, which validates the values of starting (attempts) to be VC backed. Many times I was sitting on the other side of table to ""judge"" a startup project and founders. I feel bad on both sides now that I'm be the one that being judged.

Two of us have led these sessions, and one of us is the founder of an education platform providing mentorship and training to students since 2012. With significant interest (70k+ waitlist signups) from the wider community, we're preparing to scale our platform through an AI-driven approach.

Here’s what we have so far:
- Proven Track Record: Successful sessions, student success stories, and rapidly growing interest from the community.
- Scalable Platform: Our AI-driven platform offers personalized mentorship and training at scale.
- Market Opportunity: High demand for internships, career guidance, and personalized training, which our platform addresses.

As we consider scaling, we’re evaluating initial funding options and would appreciate any guidance on our market validation and progress. We have customers waiting but need funds to serve them properly and invest in a full-time team, marketing, etc.

Our questions:
- Would our user interest and success stories suffice for approaching pre-seed investors?
- Or should we ask willing customers to pay a nominal fee even like a dollar to demonstrate our growing base?
- Or would you say we have sufficient validation with team’s background, more than a MVP product ready, and traction to secure our first round?

We're ready to scale up and have been bootstrapping for the past 3 years. Our strategy starts with student subscriptions, then white-labeling for universities. With 70k students willing to pay, we have deep market insight.

I have weekly, monthly, and quarterly discussions with companies that range from 10 to 10,000+ employees in domains that include Healthcare, Technology, Web3, Legal, Civil Engineering, and more. There’s a common theme across every company. The kids in the street call it, “Quiet Quitting.” This is killing my clients burn rate and costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Honestly, I have been experiencing quiet quitting first hand and with remote employees it can be really difficult to spot.  
  
We are living in a new world in 2024. Social media and other forms of instant messaging are making complaints more assessable than ever. TikTok influencers with no jobs are making us feel inadequate, inferior, and underpaid. Employees between the ages of 18 and 40 years old are preparing to experience true inflation for the first time in their professional career which is making everything feel expensive. For most, the idea of buying a house feeels impossible. Their personal lives are bleeding into their professional lives leaving them feeling under appreciated. Their favorite TikTok influencers are glamorizing quitting their job at an all time high and employers need to be able to understand how to identify quiet quitting and how to prevent it.  
  
I'd love to discuss the reasons behind quiet quitting, identify its signs, and discuss strategies to prevent it.

Here are some of my initial thoughts...  
  
**1. The Salve for Burnout**  
Burnout — that pervasive feeling of exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy — plagues many workplaces. Employees experience burnout when their work doesn’t align with their values or when they feel unable to make a meaningful impact. For decades, the prevailing wisdom was that work wasn’t meant to be enjoyable — it was just work. But times have changed. Quiet quitting offers a strategic disengagement from burnout. By setting healthy boundaries and refusing to overextend, employees protect their well-being and mental health.  
  
**2. Setting Healthy Boundaries**  
Quiet quitting isn’t about slacking off; it’s about setting healthy boundaries. Employees need to define what’s acceptable and unacceptable in terms of work demands. Consider these boundary-setting practices:

* Leave Work at Work: Resist the urge to take work home. Create a clear separation between professional and personal life.
* Limit After-Hours Communication: Avoid checking work messages outside of designated work hours.
* Selective Participation: Attend only essential work events and meetings.  
Respect Work Hours: Stick to the hours you were hired to work.

Setting boundaries allows employees to pursue side projects, spend time with loved ones, and safeguard their overall well-being.  


**3. Signs of Quiet Quitting**

As managers, it’s crucial to recognize the signs of quiet quitting. Here are five indicators:  


1. Reduced Productivity: When reliable employees start cutting back on special projects, it may signal a realignment of workload priorities.
2. Lack of Contribution: If team members avoid picking up each other’s slack, engagement might be waning.
3. Diminished Enthusiasm: A sudden lack of enthusiasm or passion for work can be a red flag.
4. Decreased Participation: Employees who withdraw from team interactions or avoid social functions may be quietly quitting.
5. Disengaging from Meetings: When someone tunes out during meetings, it’s worth investigating.

**4. Communication and Engagement**

Open communication is key to preventing quiet quitting. Managers should foster an environment where employees feel comfortable expressing their thoughts. Consider the following:  


* Regular Check-Ins: Schedule one-on-one conversations with team members to understand their motivations, challenges, and satisfaction levels.
* Welcoming Environment: Create a culture where employees know their thoughts will be well-received.
* Address Burnout: Discuss workload, stressors, and potential solutions.

**5. Crafting a Plan to Avoid the Wave**  
To combat quiet quitting, organizations can take proactive steps:  


* Performance Reviews: Conduct regular performance reviews to maintain ongoing dialogue with employees.
* Expectation Management: Set clear expectations early on regarding roles, responsibilities, and boundaries.
* Leadership Opportunities: Promote leadership development and learning opportunities.  
Recognition and Rewards: Acknowledge and celebrate employee achievements.
* Work-Life Balance: Respect work-life balance by allowing flexibility and autonomy.

In 2024, quiet quitting is common, it’s happening, and it doesn’t seem to be going away. Since COVID19 starting in 2020 employees are more stressed than ever and social media headlines aren’t helping any of us. I’m working with hundreds of business across multiple industries and multiple domains; this topic is everywhere like a weed. Everyone is trying to kill it. Everyone is focused on gutting it out. However, none of us have been able to find the magic sauce to cure it.  
  
By understanding its causes, recognizing the signs, and implementing preventive measures, organizations can foster healthier workplaces. Remember, it’s not about quitting — it’s about finding a sustainable balance that benefits both employees and employers.

1br0icz,,,,,,,,1711749124.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1br0icz/the_2_main_routes_of_becoming_a_millionaire/,The 2 Main Routes of becoming a Millionaire,"The 2 Main Routes of becoming a Millionaire are Entrepreneurship and Investing. The former is more difficult than the latter. The first one is required to produce excessive cashflow that is needed for the second one, i.e. investing via Real Estate or Stock Market or both! Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg became rich via Entrepreneurship, while Warren Buffett and Donald Trump through Investing!

It's true that entrepreneurship and investing are two primary paths to achieving millionaire status. Let's break down each path:  
  
Entrepreneurship: This involves starting and building a business or multiple businesses. Entrepreneurs take on significant risks in exchange for the potential rewards of building a successful enterprise. To become a millionaire through entrepreneurship, one typically needs to create a business that generates substantial cash flow and profits. This often requires a combination of innovation, hard work, resilience, and sometimes luck. Successful entrepreneurs may earn their wealth through various means, including creating and selling products or services, building successful tech startups, or establishing profitable companies in traditional industries.  
  
Examples: Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are prime examples of entrepreneurs who built billion-dollar companies—Microsoft and Facebook, respectively—from scratch.  
  
Investing: This involves deploying capital into various financial instruments with the expectation of generating returns. Successful investors grow their wealth by making informed decisions about where to allocate their funds. This can include investing in stocks, real estate, bonds, mutual funds, commodities, and other assets. While investing carries risks, it generally requires less active involvement and effort compared to entrepreneurship.  
  
Examples: Warren Buffett is renowned for his success as an investor, primarily in stocks, through his company Berkshire Hathaway. Donald Trump, although primarily known as a real estate mogul and entrepreneur, has also engaged in investing in various sectors.  
  
While both paths can lead to millionaire status, they have distinct characteristics and challenges:  
  
Entrepreneurship:  
  
Requires significant effort, creativity, and risk-taking.  
Involves building and scaling a successful business.  
Can lead to substantial wealth but often requires a longer timeframe and more dedication.  
  
Investing:  
  
Involves deploying capital into assets with the expectation of appreciation.  
Requires financial knowledge, research, and strategic decision-making.  
Can generate passive income and wealth accumulation, but success depends on market conditions and investment choices.  
Ultimately, whether entrepreneurship or investing is more challenging depends on individual strengths, preferences, and circumstances. Both paths have their own unique sets of opportunities and obstacles.

1br97dk,,,,,,,,1711773279.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1br97dk/local_subscription_based_tech_solutions_repair/,Local Subscription Based Tech Solutions / Repair Company,"Looking for advice or your experience if you’ve done this, as well as pricing suggestions.

Baseline:

I plan to offer Computer / Network / Device support as well as WebDev + Business Solutions + SEO Consulting and possibly content and management support for a locality of about 120,000 people.  There are a handful of brick-and-mortar computer repair shops on my area. The market is definitely not saturated, especially for at-home or in-office computer / network services. 

I am probably in the top 10-ish percentile of general computer / network / coding technical knowledge with some formal training in Hardware, Networks, and front end coding (HTML / CSS / JS / Python etc…).  

I enjoy building and improving “systems” (not computers necessarily, but a-z efficiencies).

I am retiring from the military after 20 years this month with a pension and my wife is a professional, so this is more of a start small and grow situation - I’m not dependent on generating a large income yet.

The Plan:

Create a well polished and functional website and make sure it is setup with solid Google SEO and associated Social Media accounts, begin advertising locally. 

Basic Residential Services:

The basic residential services offered through online bookings will be things like computer repair and troubleshooting, network and WiFi issues, Audio/Video, etc…. The base cost will be $50 to come out and see what can do and then invoice the difference. 

After the initial service completion, there will be a basic subscription plan for $25 per month, but the first month is free as a warrantee for the service performed. Then if the subscription continues I will allow three basic needs booking per month. Again, if it’s a complicated job I’ll
Invoice the difference but at a slight discount.

What I would hope would set me apart is the fact that I can come to the customer and they can create an online account for recurring billing and ease of booking. More of a professional yet local feel. 

Business Services:

I’m imagining like a professional office type of client. 

I would offer two plans. Like a mid tier and top tier. $100 / $200 subscription with 5-10 booking per month, as well as an emergency line. Again, I would invoice work in excess of the basics, but at a larger discount based on the subscription. This would give local businesses peace of mind that someone in the area is available when things go down at the worst time. 

I would also offer weekly? or monthly? Check ins, minor maintenance and updating etc… I would also then begin to dive into more of a holistic web / SEO approach to help the local business stay relevant on the googles and apples and provide consulting.

Of course I would have used accounts and autopay on lock. 

Constraints are my time and trust building as the new kid on the block. 

I don’t know how many call I will get, but here is my imagination for the first year:

1 residential call per week x $50 = $2,600 first year. 

Half of them keep a basic subscription at $25 per month = $650 first year. 

1 business call per week x $200 = $10,400 first year. 

A quarter of them choose at least a $100 monthly subscription = $1,300 first year. 

That, not including invoices above the basics and mark-ups on products, is $14,950 per year. That sounds like a small number but my hope is continued subscriptions over the course of a couple years, and the ability to provide the services without overwhelming myself. 

Anyone ever done something like this, or have any feedback on pricing or strategy?  Oh and as a fun side note - the main competitor sponsors my son’s little league team, doesn’t have a great website, and doesn’t seem to offer subscription / business IT services.

Continuing my last post, specifying the struggle to find the right technical cofounder match (it is not only about finding someone who is interested but also someone who is a good fit and ticks several boxes at once- tech stack knowledge that fits what you build, a personality that would compliment yours, business aspirations that your journey can bring him close to, you know the rest - the struggle is real and the list is long and justified).   


I then started thinking about just paying X$ to a freelancer or an agency to help me move forward as I have everything mapped out and ready (from user journeys to wireframes). 

For those of you who choose this path:

1. Was the outcome successful? what things would you recommend to avoid/pay attention to? 
2. What was a good working methodology that worked well for you? in terms of comms frequency, amount of revisions, etc, whatever?
3. Where did you find that person you worked with? Upwork? Reddit? 
4. How did you handle the post-delivery? you have an MVP delivered to you - now how do you manage bugs, improvements, helping customers with technical support, etc?
5. Did reaching that point, having an MVP with a few users, help you bring some angel investment to hire a dev?  

I know this is all product and industry-related, but any input would help. For context, I am building a web app in the world of CMS for content writers 

For example, a nice guy based out in Germany,  reached out here on Reddit, because of my last post, saying he is a freelance Full Stack with experience in X and Y, and Z. That he can do my project in 3-4 weeks. He also shared a few links to things he claimed to build.

He says he worked with multiple customers, friends, and non-friends, but he cannot let me speak to any of them. He says I can follow the link he shared with me and follow the new features he is going to push. 

He also shared his LinkedIn which shows he has only 22 connections. 

And he asking for 5K. 10% upfront. Possibility to stop at any point if milestones are not achieved. 

How can you trust that? 

Otherwise, if any of you worked with a trustworthy, dedicated, and communicative full stack developer, someone who is comfortable with coding front end (react, angular) and backend, I am happy to speak to anyone. Some experience in front-end could be useful for this product as well.

- The ""Insane"" co-founder is likened to Willy Wonka, overflowing with creativity and relentless drive, championing seemingly impossible ideas that can become game-changers.
- A successful co-founder duo embodies a ""Ying Yang"" dynamic, with a partnership built on mutual respect, open communication, and the ability to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses.
- Finding the perfect co-founder match requires knowing your own strengths and weaknesses, seeking someone who complements your skillset and personality, establishing clear communication channels, and sharing a clear vision for the startup.

As probably a lot of us out there that start a newsletter from scratch, I have had my fair share of struggles when it came to growing my subscriber list.  
  
The general “newsletter guru” advice of posting on social media platforms (my choice was LinkedIn, Twitter and Insta) did bring in some traffic, but it wasn’t a game changer.   
  
Kind of by accident I came across a method, which is definitely not new, but I haven’t really seen it being used or talked about for newsletter growth.  
  
I have another company, where we have a database of intent data, which basically tells you what people are actually looking or researching for, based on their web content searching.   
At this point we had accumulated close to 8 million emails from intent data providers about users, who are actually looking for something.  
  
So, this week I decided to filter out the intent leads that would be relevant for my newsletter niche (finance, economy and tech), and sent out emails to people who are actually researching and looking for solutions in these areas.  
  
So far, I got a 37% open rate of the “intent” emails sent and I had a subscriber conversion rate of 2.88% (I’ve sent just over 800 intent emails). I’ve got just over 25 new subs, which may not seem like a lot, but for an early stage newsletter like mine this is the best result I’ve gotten out of all the previous methods I've tried.  
  
Also, the traffic I’ve got increased dramatically as a result.  
  
Obviously, I was fortunate that I have this other company with the intent data database. I’m thinking if there’s merit to this, and maybe creating a service out of this.   
  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I’d like to validate this idea first with more newsletters - if you have a newsletter with at least 5 posts, you can write me a DM and i’ll send you 100 intent emails for your niche and a short SOP on how to send them. All I ask in return, is that you would give me feedback afterwards, whether it brought traffic to your website/newsletter, and whether you got any subs out of it.  
  
Would this add value to your newsletter? And what would you be willing to pay for a service that would generate traffic with people from your particular niche?   
  
Like all of us, I have limited capacity, so I’ll do it for the first 10 to DM me with their newsletter link, stating their niche and what value is your newsletter adding to the reader.

Hope you’re doing well. Firstly, let me introduce myself -

My name is Joy. I’m a product manager and entrepreneur based in the UK. Over the last 10 years, I have built and grown digital-first businesses in multiple markets. My last exit was a fitness-tech startup: EzToned. I’m passionate about bootstrapping and digital growth is all I understand and love to do.

Now, here’s the story -

In mid 2022, I decided to take a break from my entrepreneurial journey as I was burnt out and needed some time to step back to find out what my “why” and my next steps. I took up a PM job and decided to take a year or two to figure this out.

I networked with my colleagues and industry professionals. During conversations, I realised that many of my peers were unhappy, didn’t enjoy their 9-5s but felt like they couldn’t take the jump and start/grow something by themselves for many reasons. One of them was not having access to or knowing complimentary skill set individuals who would help them with execution.

Reflecting on my own journey and experiences, I realised that just like them, many more people out there who do take the leap to face similar challenges. I found myself constantly thinking about this problem to the point where I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I also realised that I enjoyed helping people out with their business growth challenges and looking back, the part I enjoyed most was bringing innovative products to market.

I started ideating a platform where founders could get an expert growth team that would help them build and grow their venture affordably. Before building, I wanted to gauge demand for something like this. So, I decided to test by offering free customer acquisition help to startup founders on Reddit in December -

https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/s/v4CmEhQEYv

I got swamped with 200+ messages. Since then, I have been working with a few startup founders and teams, helping them build and improve their growth strategies. 

Over the last 3 months, i have found that many of the startups I was working with seek clarity and find immediate value with an actionable and strategic growth strategy. So, I built these for a few and then started building growth teams who could help create and execute these at scale. 

Now, me and my team are building our MVP for DGV OS, which is currently at alpha stage here: https://digitalgrowth.ventures

As a part of our alpha launch, we want to work closely with many more founders. So, we are offering a free growth strategy call for startups until we are at full capacity.

During the 30m call, I and our team will review your current growth situation, business model and growth aspirations to craft you a growth strategy that you can take away and implement by yourself to predictably drive revenue or user base growth. There is no obligation to work with us or try OS after the call.

I hope this isn’t viewed as an ad and we are able to help a few companies out there. Please feel free to reach out if you need any growth help :)",False,0.0081435,"The author of the post, Joy, mentions that he is a product manager and entrepreneur who has built and grown digital-first businesses over the last 10 years.

By offering unique pricing strategy,  
- 0% commission on seller's  
- I will take x% from seller if they opt for in house negotiater ( meaning i will talk to buyer for them )  
- Buyers pay a yearly retainer for categories of startup they wanna sub. ( i.e: if buyer only interested in buying projects less then $2k, then he can sub for only 49$ yearly, and while buyer who wants to buy 10k+ can sub with 399$ yearly )

but I’ve been working in marketing & startups for almost a decade now.. 

Been consulting early stage SaaS startup’s setting their GTM, Marketing, cold outreach etc to pay my bills.

He’s from Sweden.. and has experience building complex products. 

Some how I liked his confidence and his previous work.

In the course of next two weeks we started brainstorming a bunch of ideas on what to build.. criteria was simple..something that’s solving something at fundamental level.. isn’t platform dependent.. has a validated market..

And we fixated on [cocomail](https://www.cocomail.io/) 

Email automation platform for SaaS..

Send transactional + marketing emails..

You can automate email communication based on event triggers.. send one off product updates.. newsletters. Etc..

We started writing about it on x.  

Listed on few directories..

Announced on reddit. 

We’ve got some 100 odd singups for waitlist. 

And we went live publicly 4 days back..

And we have a paid user today.. who migrated from a big player like mailgun..

I’m reaching out for advice on a unique situation my team and I are facing with our AI-based EdTech SaaS product. Our product stands as the most comprehensive and all-encompassing solution in the current market, offering unparalleled features:

	1.	The generation of both objective and subjective questions from virtually any source material—text, posts, audio, video, YouTube links, Wikipedia links, or any article link.
	2.	A gameplay system where users can challenge themselves with the generated questions, compete with others, follow favorite question creators, and even see where they stand on a global leaderboard.
	3.	The capability to export the generated questions in multiple formats (doc, pdf, etc.), making it easy to use them for exams in real-world settings.
	4.	A wide array of supplementary features, including hints, detailed answer explanations, and an auto evaluation and grading system, among others.

And there are a lot of other features as well but you get the idea.

The journey to create this software began in college, with a group of computer science students (myself included) who had a knack for coding but no prior business experience. Despite these limitations, we were driven by a mission to create the best possible edtech software in the market. Our efforts seemed to pay off as we quickly garnered over 1,000 organic users and received glowing feedback from EdTech enthusiasts and professors who were impressed by our advanced offerings compared to other big players in the market.

Interestingly, despite the software’s apparent success and potential, we never officially launched it in the market. We didn’t open up the payment gateways, so all our users accessed the free version of the product. This decision—or lack thereof—stemmed from a failure in leadership and direction. The co-founder team, composed of four individuals (my self included) with differing visions for the company’s future, struggled to agree on a market entry strategy. This discord led to significant delays, and personally, it drove me to start a new venture on my own, which quickly took off (in about a month), unlike our stagnant SaaS project (one year +).

After much deliberation, and recognizing that our individual paths and projects have diverged significantly, I recently set up a call with the other cofounders and agreed that selling the SaaS would be our best course of action. Despite its potential to go to the moon, our collective inability to work together towards a unified goal has convinced us that an acquisition is the right move. However, we face the challenge of not having launched officially, leaving us without key financial metrics like MRR or ARR to present to potential buyers. 

Yet, our startup has been evaluated at over $3 million by Startup Falcon (though I’m unsure of the accuracy of this evaluation but we’d be happy considering 1/3rd of that evaluation because we are based in South Asia and have limited opportunities ). Additionally, we were standout graduates from one of the top accelerators in our country, received grants, and even caught the interest of notable VCs, including Iterative from Southeast Asia—all achieved through bootstrapping and without taking on investors.

Given this context, I’m seeking your wisdom on how best to approach the process of getting our software acquired.

Let's get real for a second. In the gold rush of SaaS, AI and GPT, it's easy to get caught up in features, valuations, and that next round of funding. 

But at the core, shouldn't our software be about making a tangible difference?

Quick Question.

1. What real-world problems is your saas solving? 

2. Does it streamline workflows, boost efficiency, or solve a specific challenge we face every day?  

3. Or, deep down, is it primarily a way to generate revenue, features tacked onto a problem that might not even exist?

Let's be honest - there's a place for both. But in a crowded market, standing out requires a focus on value. 

Let’s get interactive 

Share your SaaS and the real-world problem it solves. 

Remember, a successful SaaS isn't just profitable - it makes a difference.

Besides this liquid million, I do have investments in a variety of stocks and indices of around ~300K. 

These are my investment ideas so far and I am looking to better understand on how much I should invest in each category to keep a healthy balance between safe vs risky bets:

1) IRA: safest?
2) Index funds: Safe in long term, not sure which ones to look at besides S&P, Dow Jones. How much should I invest here and in which ones? I’ve heard there are a bunch of ETFs people look at, what’s a good resource that could help me understand this better besides the first few articles on google? 
3) Short Term Trading: Big Tech, Big Pharma, maybe Defense? (Is this relatively safe? How short should be short term? What other kind of stocks should I invest in)
4) Angel Investing: In series D and series E startups. Is this lucrative, what is the success vs failure rate in this, where can I find out this info, approx how much should I bet here?
5) Real Estate: Something that is easy to manage. I want to retire so I want to invest in minimal effort properties, I don’t believe buying individual homes gives me this freedom and I’ve read that commercial real estate is even more complicated. 
6) Small Business: I don’t want to run or manage a business but I am happy to invest as a silent partner. Should I do this? What kind of businesses should I look at for this? Is it a good idea to invest in a friends’s business? If not, how to trust strangers?
7) Day Trading: If I am able to retire, I would just do this in my free time (in addition to managing the rest of my money) to be productive but I am not sure where to start looking to gain knowledge on this. 
8) Certificate Deposits, HYSA, Treasury Bonds: Are Bonds still a good idea? 
9) Sell My Business: What are some factors I should use to evaluate the selling price? I have about 2000 clients to who I sell a personalized service.

My goal is to multiply the million dollars into $10M in 5-8 years. My second goal is to make atleast $300K each year in interest/dividends/gains without liquidating a lot of my investments. I have a family of 6 dependent on me so having $300K per year would help us all live comfortably while I am retired.

After that system will check the availability of these domains and show you only those that you can register right away.  
You don't have to think much about domain names, this tool will do it for you. And also removes one of the issues I had when coming up with the domain names: a domain being registered or parked. Usually being ask for a high price to buy the domain name.

We have a business together and each have individual talents such as videography, graphic design, fitness, accounting etc. So whenever something needs to be done in the business I reach out to the ones that at excel at their individual lanes because it doesn't make sense for me to try to learn something I'm not the best at.

However, I've noticed over the years they don't do the same for me. If there's a website needed to be done, they try to do it themselves. If there's a logo/brand design needed, they try to do it themselves without reaching out to me. It results in things being done with subpar results and often needs me to come in and improve it after which takes up more time when they could have come to me initially.

At times it starts to feel insulting. Why are you trying to do something you know I'm a professional at? Especially in a business setting where this affects us all as a whole. At times i've asked and they've stated ""I don't want to give you more work"" but that feels more like an excuse for them really just not wanting me to do it.

I'm thinking about growing/scaling and further systemizing my business. Part of this means (I think) I need to work on a system and a method to ""step away"" as the primary sales person. 

As our companies best salesperson by a long shot (I have one salesperson that works remote that I would not trust with my personal customers), I naturally have formed relationships and trust with a lot of my customers and they are used to dealing with me. 

I'd like to start to think about a long term strategy to ideally ""gently"" transition them to someone else so that I can focus more on the business strategy and less on the direct elements of day-to-day selling. 

My original plan was to grow a call center type sales team, but over the past 1.5 years of trying to build this it just isn't working out the way I thought. The people I hire are more cost effective than an experienced local salesperson, but they just don't have the skills and ability to really handle large customers or grow and maintain the relationship like I can. I really want to ""let go"" of the control of this aspect of the business in the long term. Of course, I'm extremely nervous to do so because without sales and our biggest customers, there won't be a business. 

I'm thinking about potentially hiring the right someone that is a more ""professional"" salesperson (more experience, previous industry experience, demands more salary) that can work in office. With the hope that I can coach them and trust them enough to start to transition my customers to them without losing a ton of business. It might even be something I can afford already with the volume of business that I currently do myself. 

Does this sound like the right strategy? Should I be thinking about this a different way? 

I just really want to be able to take a vacation some day and know that everything and everyone is taken care of through the systems and people in place.

You can find my previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/182okhk/how\_i\_went\_from\_2k\_per\_month\_to\_45k\_per\_month\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/182okhk/how_i_went_from_2k_per_month_to_45k_per_month_in/)

I will quickly summarise:

I bought a business whilst working a full time job, and managed to take it from 2k per month to now over 80k per month.

I've learnt a lot along the way, and there is a lot I would have done differently in hindsight, but learning is all a part of the journey.

From previous post:

* July - £12k
* August - £4k
* September - £21k
* October - £25k
* November (MTD 24th Nov) - £35k (Finished on £46k)

Update: 

* December 23: £79k
* January 24: £39k (ran out of stock from Dec climb)
* February 24: £60k
* March: £80k

As you can see, were are steadily and consistently growing. A few weeks ago I quit my full time job and will be working on this business full time from May 2024, so I'm looking forward to what the future holds, and hopefully taking this to the next level.

Biggest challenges from the past 4 months:

* Cashflow - as stock purchases are quite large and you always need enough cash to fuel growth and run ads. (profit != cashflow)
* Stock forecasting (making sure we don't sell out)
* Maintaining ROAS as we scale
* Maintaining my day job whilst this has become more time consuming(won't have to worry soon)
* Customer service - have hired some support here
* VAT (UK based), as this now eats into our margins

I'm now starting some other opportunites, and looking to meet people on a similar journey, so please feel free to ask any questions in the comments!

I am currently doing a handful of other projects in life and don't have much time to devote to learning as I go through development, so I would like to task this part out to someone else.I have been in the summer camp industry for 20 years. I will take care of the sales portion and plan to maintain ownership of the company. I am not in the position to pay upfront; however, I am willing to negotiate how you would be compensated over time. I would look at something like a percentage of sales, of course, with the additional potential to move into a salaried position over time. I am also open to your input on this piece. This agreement would be made in writing with clear expectations for both sides.

I built two startups before. I personally and strongly feel the pain point that getting ready to test a new product takes time, even if you’re super focused and know how to do it time and capital efficiently. In addition, there are way too many generative AI tools in the market (to speed up the process) and most people don't know which one is suitable for them.

Summary:  

We are developing a platform that streamlines the process of launching new products and validating business ideas for startups, product innovation teams, and corporate clients. The platform integrates various Generative AI tools to automate the creation of essential assets, such as landing pages, pitch decks, product wireframes, and marketing materials. Our approach involves chaining together best-in-class AI tools (note: these tools were built by other companies; we chain them together) using our proprietary code, creating a user-friendly experience that requires minimal input from the client.

As these tools are basically asking for the same information, users simply need to answer a set of 5-10 questions about their product or business idea, target audience, and key features. Our system then generates a comprehensive package of assets, including: a. Landing pages, b. Pitch decks c. Product wireframes d. SEO-optimized content e. Company/product videos.  

In addition, the platform includes built-in features such as authentication, database integration, and connectivity with popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord. 

Target audience:

1. Product innovation teams within larger organizations seeking to test new concepts and gather market feedback rapidly.  
2. Startups looking to validate their ideas and bring their products to market quickly.  
3. Corporate clients aiming to streamline their innovation processes and leverage AI-powered tools for increased efficiency and effectiveness.  


Questions I have:

  
1. Do you think it is a painful problem and it offers good value proposition?

2. Early-stage entrepreneurs are a bad target audience (not willing or able to pay). Should I forget completely about early-stage startups?

3. Around business model, one-off payment is usually not a good business model, especially at ticket sizes like $39-199. Any suggestions on building a recurring revenue model?

4. I feel like we don't have a narrow enough focus. Any suggestions on starting in a niche market? 

5. It also feel likes this service should be provided as a side business rather than a core business. Any thoughts on that?


All comments will be highly appreciated. Thank you very much!

We parted ways (amicably) a few days ago. We're just left with the CEO and COO.. there are just 2 of us working on this full time.

Reasons for the CTO's departure:

- Required more work than what he was willing to give
- Didn't want to follow through with the pivot we're likely going to do based on new compelling data
- Didn't have the founder's mindset to learn new tech to keep up with the product's requirements and to find new ways to do things better / test new things

We have compelling data to support the next phase, potential users, a contract tech team that can make the product, and an interim CTO who's super technically competent and can guide the contract tech team, which we'll likely pay for as he probably won't take this on full time. 

In parallel, we're planning to find a permanent CTO that will meet the needs of the company in it's current phase. We want to take the right amount of time to find this person and not rush into a commitment.

We want to go for pre-seed funding to get this pivoted product built.. do you think VCs will not like this setup and not want to invest?

1bs3ck3,,,,,,,,1711864955.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1bs3ck3/how_to_run_a_product_successful_drop/,How to run a product successful drop," This post is for people who run drop-based brands with very limited quantity. This includes clothing brands, collectible brands, or anyone that has a very limited stock of products and more than 5,000 emails on their email list.

  
I run the emails for a bunch of rappers' and influencers' clothing brands. 7 years ago, my partner and I both had dreams of being big-time music producers. We ended up getting into marketing 4 years ago, but we stayed active in the music industry. In fact, my partner Oj2milly produced 2 songs on the new Yeat album. 

  
A lot of rappers/influencers have “Drop-based” brands, where they only sell merch a few times a year, but they always sell out. This is the back-end marketing sauce that we use to make sure every single drop sells out every time.

  
Emails  
Pre-Drop: There are about 3 emails that you can send before the drop to create hype.

  
1. Trust-building email – Use pictures of happy customers showing products from your previous drop. You also want to screenshot reviews and add them to this email. Touch on the main aspects of concern, you need reviews that mention quick shipping time, good customer service, and great product quality. If famous people rock with your brand, this is the perfect chance to showcase that. Here is a quick story, I work with a local hat store in Toronto. One day Swae-Lee stopped by and purchased a hat. The owner got a picture with Swae Lee and to this day we leverage that in marketing. One time we made an email before a drop and the subject was “What do you and Swae Lee have in common”. Open rates skyrocketed because of the curiosity that we built around that email. Moral of the story, we got more eyes on the new collection, and we sold out twice as fast as the previous drop.  
2. Drop announcement- This is where you give a sneak peek of the new drop. If you made a marketing video or have other influencers posting about your brand, this is the email where you redirect traffic to your other marketing channels and build hype.  
3. The countdown- Announce the official drop date. Mention how fast things sold out last time and tell people to mark their calendars and be ready. You can even add an HTML timer to this email to spice things up.  
4. Reminder (optional)- If you sent the countdown email more than 3 days before the real drop, it’s a good idea to send a reminder email the day before the drop. You’ll see brands like TRAPSTAR do this a lot, they almost always have an email that goes out the day before the drop, and sometimes they use HTML timers as well.

  
Drop Day: On the day of the drop, you just want to send out 1 email, but sometimes we make multiple versions of this email based on people's buying habits.

  
1. Drop is now Live⚡- This is simple, you tell people that the new drop is available, and you showcase the products. For larger brands (email list over 20k customers), you'll have to segment the email list. Here’s an example of 1 way that we segment email lists and slightly modify the emails. We’ll split the list into 3 sections, VIPS (Repeat buyers), One-time Buyers, and non-buyers. VIPS will receive the email first, you can say things like “Hey {{name}}, we wanted to notify you first because you’re a VIP, get yours before others realize the drop is live”, this makes it more personal. Its phrased as an opportunity to handpick limited items first instead of a marketing pitch. You can change the non-buyer email slightly by adding more social proof and by talking about how limited the opportunity is to try out things from the brand. All these emails will be basically the same but tweaking small things can improve the conversion rate.

  
Post-drop: The number of emails post-drop varies. Sometimes products sell out after the first email, but other times we have to keep pushing the traffic. Here are 3 emails that we send out after the drop day:

  
1. Stock is running low- In this email, you use scarcity to try to get people to make an impulse purchase.  
2. Incentive to buy x product- Let's say there is 1 product in your drop that needs to be pushed. Here are a couple of ways to drive some extra sales. You can say there's a chance at a freebie if you buy x product. You can say buying x product will put you on our VIP list for early access to future drops or exclusive discounts. The goal here is to get creative and not to directly discount the product.  
3. Social proof- If you’re a newer brand this email is very important, this is similar to the first email that was sent out. You showcase positive buying experiences and build trust by showing real people with the products in hand. 

  
SMS  
SMS is broken down into 3 texts  
1. Countdown- Ex. New drop live Monday 6 pm EST: check out the preview \*here\*  
2. Now live- Ex. Our new collection is now available, check it out \*here\*  
3. We’re about to sell out- Ex. Last chance to get your favorites from our new collection. Stock is running low in your size. \*Shop Now\*

  
As you know, what I stated above is only half of the marketing puzzle. This is just what you do on the backend. For famous people, they can rely on their clout to push front-end traffic. For people who aren’t famous, you’ll still need to run ads or get influencers on board. Thanks for reading my post, I hope I inspired some of your guys to set up your backend marketing more in-depth before your next drop.

&#x200B;

We currently use Stripe to take payments for a monthly subscription to the app.

&#x200B;

The good thing about using stripe is we don't have to pay the 15% fee Apple would take with in-app payments.

&#x200B;

However around 50% of people who subscribe end up as ""past due"" normally due to people using temporary cards etc.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any thoughts/experience in going from Stripe > In-App payments? Would this solve the issue of people using temporary cards etc.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking that even though Apple would take 15% it would be more than worth it if people instinctively just used the card connected to their phone... as opposed to using a temporary one etc.

My name is Joy. I’m a product manager and entrepreneur based in the UK. Over the last 10 years, I have built and grown digital-first businesses in multiple markets. My last exit was a fitness-tech startup: EzToned. I’m passionate about bootstrapping and digital growth. This is all I understand and love to do!

Here’s my story -

In mid 2022, I decided to take a break from my entrepreneurial journey as I was burnt out and needed some time to step back to find out what my “why” and my next steps. I took up a PM job and decided to take a year or two to figure this out.

I networked with my colleagues and industry professionals. During conversations, I realised that many of my peers were unhappy, didn’t enjoy their 9-5s but felt like they couldn’t take the jump and start/grow something by themselves for many reasons. One of them was not having access to or knowing complimentary skill set individuals who would help them with execution.

Reflecting on my own journey and experiences, I realised that just like them, many more people out there who do take the leap to face similar challenges. I found myself constantly thinking about this problem to the point where I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I also realised that I enjoyed helping people out with their business growth challenges and looking back, the part I enjoyed most was bringing innovative products to market.

I started ideating a platform where founders could get an expert growth team that would help them build and grow their venture affordably. Before building, I wanted to gauge demand for something like this. So, I decided to test by offering free customer acquisition help to startup founders on Reddit in December -

https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/s/v4CmEhQEYv

I got swamped with 200+ messages. Since then, I have been working with a few startup founders and teams, helping them build and improve their growth strategies. 

Over the last 3 months, i have found that many of the startups I was working with seek clarity around where they should be focusing their growth efforts and find immediate value with an actionable and strategic growth strategy. 

So, I built these for a few and then started building growth teams who could help create and execute these at scale. 

Now, me and my team are building our MVP for DGV OS, which is currently at alpha stage here: https://digitalgrowth.ventures

As a part of our alpha launch, we want to work closely with many more founders. So, we are offering a free growth strategy call for startups until we are at full capacity.

During the 30m call, I and my team will review your current growth situation, business model and growth aspirations to craft you a personalised growth strategy that you can take away and implement by yourself to predictably drive revenue or user base growth. There is no obligation to work with us or try OS after the call.

So it has to be a Telegram bot, or it can be located on a website and the website just sends the notifications to telegram bot.

The goal of this bot is to track new listings on a website - that listing has links on the project twitter and website - bot needs to immediately after the listing check the twitter of the listing on how many posts it has, what is the engagement rate, how many followers it has and maybe something more. 

Then it checks if it has website.

Then it it visits two different websites and inserts the name of the project to check some info - and if the info is good - the listing is good to be in a notification of the bot.

1byufxb,,,,,,,,1712571917.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1byufxb/tip_ship_fast_learn_faster_than_mvps/,Tip: Ship Fast & Learn FASTER than MVPs,"As a PM working at SaaS companies in the US, I used to think that the fastest way of validating a concept was through an MVP (minimum viable product). At my past companies, it'd take about 4 to 6 weeks to ship an MVP (initial research, PRD, code, QA, ship, post-ship analysis).   
But a few years ago, I learned a faster way to validate an idea from a product leader (Teresa Torres). It's a way to validate an idea in just 1 day with 5 users.  
Seems too good to be true. Seems like fake news. But it's not... but it's also not what you expect either.   
Let me explain how it works, and you'll see what I mean.  
Start with the MVP you're thinking of building.  
Then, think about all of the assumptions that you have about the MVP.   
For example, at the onboarding step, you assume that users will know what to click to go to the next screen. That seems like it's a fact to you (it's so obvious!), but in reality, it's an assumption. We assume it's intuitive that users know what to click (but it's not a fact).   
Another example is that after users read your landing page, they will find sufficient value for your prodcut or service that they will pay for it. Once again, this is an assumption you're making. Maybe you're only 50% confident about this one.  
These are just 2 assumptions, but you can think of many more assumptions. The point is NOT to test them all - nor should you. Because there are some assumptions that are super important to the success of your MVP, and others that are not that important. Plus, there are some assumptions that you're 99% sure about, and others where you are only 1% sure about.    
What you want to do is narrow down your list of assumptions to the top 2 or 3 assumptions that   
1) are super important to the success of your MVP (i.e., they need to be true... otherwise, your MVP will fail) and   
2) you have very low confidence in.    
Then, you test those assumptions with 5 users.   
Why 5 users?   
HOW DARE YOU QUESTION ME!??!!?! 😡  
j/k great question - you should always exercise critical thinking 🙃  
I chose 5 users for this example but it could be higher or lower - it really depends on you. How many users do you need to talk to in order to feel good about the general direction (we're NOT looking for 100% confidence at this step).  
Okay, then what do we test?  
Using our example of ""at this step, users will buy my product / service"" - you can think, ""What's a super cheap & fast way you can test this?""    
Well, you can come up with a quick mock up of the screen (pencil sketch may be okay). Then, you can ask 5 users a simple question:  
What would you do next?    
If 2 out of 5 users say they'll buy, then you know you're on to something. You're not 100% sure - it's not statistically significant, but at this step, you're not looking to be 100% sure. All you want to know is whether you're going in the general right direction.   
BUT.... if 0 out of 5 users say they'll buy, well... this is an issue. That means that the core assumption of this MVP (i.e., it produces enough value that they'll buy) is untrue... because if 0 out of 5 users say they will NOT buy, this is a sign that there isn't enough value with your MVP.    
So from here, you have a few choices:  
1) fix your MVP so that it adds more value or   
2) make your value proposition clearer in your copy or explanation or   
3) you realize this MVP is not what you should be building, and you move on to something else.    
If you decide #3 is the right option for you, then... wow....  
Let's take a moment to think about what this means...   
You just saved yourself DAYS / WEEKS of valuable time (building the MVP, marketing it, etc....) with an investment of 1 day and 5 users! 🤯  
That's an unbelievable ROI (return on investment)!  
Essentially, what you did was increase your learning velocity aka the pace at which you learn about your product, customers, and market.   
Indie hackers who ship fast is good, but those that maximize their learning velocity is better.  
Hope this helps y'all ship faster, and learn even faster! 🚀",False,0.0212699999999999,"Post is irrelevant because it is authored by a technical individual, focusing on product management strategies and methods for validating product ideas rather than seeking a technical co-founder or software development services.

And since the past one year there were issues with a cofounder, so we recently drafted a SHA and wanted to begin reverse vesting, and wanted a sign of all cofounders on it, the company's performance is really bad.. we have reached a product market fit, very low sales, trying to reach more people.

The problematic cofounder, hasn't been actively working since the past one year, has given up on his responsibilities, so the other four had to bare the workload, and he does some mere work which could be done by inexperienced interns, but is always first in travel and PR when opportunities come, and he disagreed to sign on the SHA. He didn't negotiate on the points, especially to move to and work from Bengaluru, but it is crucial for company's survival, so we weren't backing down on it, he didn't even suggest alternatives, so we asked him to leave the company and we will buyback shares.

We are young adults - don't have deep pockets, nor did we take salary, so while negotiating for a buyback the problematic cofounder started asking for INR 15,00,000 without any basis of valuation for an exit, we wanted it to be at INR 1,00,000, but could only bring it down to INR 3,00,000 but we have money for only INR 1,00,000 and also putting in the money we have in the startup risking our operations also doesn't help us get to INR 3,00,000..

A customer came to us with his requirements. And we just built and launched a functioning product for them.   


After launch, the product blew up. It got a lot of attention and we saw 5000 downloads on Chrome Web Store after a couple months. (Currently it's sitting at 10k downloads)  


That product alone was so successful that the client then came to us for the development of more of his product ideas, and we started shipping those as well. I never asked the client about how the first product got successful and what's the ""scale"" of that success.   


A few months later, I had a call with him and he told me that the Chrome Extension SaaS we built for him helped him 3x his primary business's revenue. How? By upselling his local marketing services to the users of that extension.  


This really blew my mind. He built a SaaS product, just as a lead magnet, and even that lead magnet was generating revenue. And then he was able to upsell his more expensive services to those users.   


Absolutely brilliant.  


Lessons:  
Instead of thinking about random ideas to work on, work on what you already have expertise in. SaaS and AI are a huge trend right now. Build a small product and start marketing it. Your goal should be to upsell your more expensive services, instead of just selling subscriptions.

You can't afford to spend months or even years perfecting every last detail before launching. That's a surefire way to fall behind the competition and miss your window of opportunity.  
This is where agile methodologies come into play. Agile is all about breaking down your product development into rapid, iterative cycles, with a focus on getting a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) out there as quickly as you can.  
But what exactly is an MVP, and how does an agile approach support its creation? Let me break it down for you:  
**The Power of the MVP**

  
An MVP is the most basic version of your product that still delivers value to users. It contains only the core features and functionality needed to solve the primary problem you're addressing. The key is to get this MVP into the hands of real people as soon as possible, so you can start gathering feedback and learning.  
This rapid, iterative approach stands in contrast to the traditional ""waterfall"" method of product development, where you meticulously plan everything out in advance before building. With an MVP, you embrace the uncertainty and are willing to adapt based on what you learn.  
**Agile Practices for Quick Iteration**

  
Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban provide the framework to enable this rapid, user-focused product development. Some of the core agile practices that support quick iteration on an MVP include:  
• Short, time-boxed sprints or cycles (often 2-4 weeks) where you build and release a new version of your product  
• Daily check-ins and frequent feedback loops to course-correct as needed  
• A laser focus on the highest-priority features and user stories  
• Embracing change and iteration rather than rigid, upfront planning  
**The Beauty of the Feedback Loop**

  
The real power of the agile MVP approach comes from the feedback loop you establish with users. By getting your initial MVP in front of people quickly, you can start gathering real-world data on how they're using it, what's working, and what needs improvement.  
This user feedback then informs the next iteration of your product, where you can add new functionality, fix bugs, or refine the existing features. Rinse and repeat. Each cycle brings you closer to a truly valuable solution that resonates with your target audience.  
The key is to stay nimble and flexible. Don't get attached to your original ideas or plans. Be willing to evolve and pivot based on what you learn. That's the essence of the agile MVP mindset.  
Embracing this approach may feel uncomfortable if you're used to more traditional, linear product development. But the payoff is worth it – you'll get to market faster, conserve resources, and ultimately build something that your users truly want.  
So forget about perfection. Focus on getting that initial MVP out there, then use agile practices to quickly iterate and improve. That's the secret to successful, user-centric product development.

Of course using ChatGPT API. You can call it a wrapper for sure. I hired someone on UpWork to design the site, it's like a google search, when you search a stock ticker, it show you the latest earnings call transcript, and than you can get summary by the AI. I launched it around June 1st 2023, I posted on some subreddit like /ValueInvesting and got some good feedback, then I added some features based on feedback such as earnings metric (eps, revenue), pricing chart of when earnings released in the past. and historical earnings call  summaries. Then I added a checkout page with stripe integrated. I relaunched in around Sep, but no one pay for the service, around oct, I got 1 paying user, and I emailed him nicely to ask feedback, then he said he accidentally subscribe and how to cancel the service. So I was kind of giving up the project, but during Thanksgiving holiday, I really want to give the site another shot, so I fixed a bunch of issues and email all the users that if they are interested to discount coupon to subscribe. I finally landed 1st paying customer, also I fixed another critical bug after chatting with my 1st angel subscriber. It's really amazing to have 1st paying user. Then I spent another 1 to 2 months try to grow the subscribers. It's still hard, I tried all kinds of marketing, from reddit ads, social medial ads, linkedin, SAAS directory submit, SEO etc. 

I am currently having around 20 paying users. I realized that most institutional or professional investors won't use this site for equity research, since they have so many tools like Bloomberg, but the site get a lot of interests from other professional like consulting and strategic roles. People who want to have quick first hand knowledge from public company earnings call, can use the site to grab what they need, especially you can ask your own questions to a specific earnings call, and the AI to will provide your answer(with in the context of that earnings call transcript). So it has some business potential, but I am not sure I will spend another year to build this project, most likely keep it afloat now. 

I am sharing this site here and hopefully to get some feedback, for example, pricing, I only have 1 pricing option, just try to keep it simple, also it's tricky to integrate the stripe.

While I'm sure this advice is applicable to most industries, I will say that we only tested this in eCommerce (physical goods) and SaaS / Mobile Apps. From January until now we've spent $2.1m between Meta, TikTok, X and Snapchat. YTD we saw a 32% reduction in cost per customer acquisition across the board and it's in large part due to the following:

**1. Multivariate Ad Creative Testing**

Simply put, the difference of swapping out ONE COLOR in your ad creative can result in a 1.5% CTR versus 4% CTR (click-through rate). So what do you think happens when you change scenery (day/night) or the model (young/old/male/female)? Same is true for the words you use to talk about your product, be it spoken by your content creator or the text that appears in your static image ads. Now when we work with a UGC creator or 3D animator, we NEVER just get 1 piece of media to test. We found the best approach is to have our video editors/designers swap 2 variables at a time because you want to cover maximum ground while not overwhelming yourself with a million media files to test. This is probably the #1 missed opportunity for most companies. They're all sitting on a Google drive content folder that is collecting dust while being full of raw clips/photos that can be turned into countless winning ads.

Even yesterday we had one test with identical visuals, where only the wording was swapped. One had a $43 CPA (unprofitable) saying ""Charge 2x faster with this indestructible cable"" versus $25 CPA saying ""This unbreakable cable charges twice as fast."" Same visuals, same campaign, same everything, just a difference in wording. If we only tested the 1st version & saw the $43 CPA, we would've turned it off and called the ad a loser.

**2. Messaging Segmentation**

How you talk about your product/service and which selling angles you focus on will resonate more with some people than others. ""Hypoallergenic bed sheets"" vs ""Ultra soft bed sheets"" are two headlines for the same product that attract two different subsets of customers. The beauty of paid ads on social media is that each ad can identify and reach the user who resonates with it. Unfortunately, 9 in 10 companies I meet with aren't taking advantage of this. They speak about their products in a very linear way that was ""ordained"" by the founder / product engineer then parroted by everyone working at the company. Most companies test far too few ads given their budgets, because there is an illusion that you can have ""1 supreme ad"" that beats everything else. When, in reality, you should be scaling MANY ads simultaneously. Heck, it's the only way TO scale if you ever want to spend $2K, $5K, or even $10K in a single day.

Another way to think of this is... if you're selling a supplement that promotes healthier, more radiant skin. You'd talk about it one way to younger female audiences who deal with breakouts/acne versus older female audiences who prioritize firmness & anti-wrinkle effects. Even if the same product addresses both, you want to separate out your messaging & visuals to appeal to each segment of your target audience.

**3. Engagement Prompts**

I briefly touched on this in the post I made here 5 months ago. Since then, we have literally tripled down on this strategy because, thanks to it, our ads are seeing an extra 15-25% lift in impressions that we don't pay for. It's derived from shares & people tagging their friends. (Screenshots of our ads have even made their way here to Reddit where we got another boost of impressions).

So, how it works is that we basically leave crumbs throughout our ads that would promote discourse in the comments. ""Who needs to see this?"" or ""Do you agree?"" or ""What's your take on this?"", you get the idea. We want people to tag their friend. We want that friend to respond. Next thing you know, there's a back & forth going on in our comments. Meta (& other platforms) see a high engagement rate & their algorithm correlates this to higher ad engagement & quality. This means we're rewarded with higher reach & lower CPMs. More so than that, we are also getting this free/organic exposure ""tailwind"" which greatly helps our margins.

\-- And that's the post. Hope this helps someone who is struggling to scale their ads profitably.

Screenshot of my earnings across platforms: https://imgur.com/a/w18wiB4

To make a long story short, I sell rare snacks & Buc-ee's merch online and started this hustle back in Aug. 2023, after reading an article about Chris Koerner who created an online store selling Buc-ee's food & merch (which was successful because Buc-ee's doesn't have an online presence.) Apparently, he does 6figs in sales each month. 

  
I initially stumbled upon that article on a site called lipstickalley, then found two follow-ups [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buceestx/comments/14m7bu5/texas_snax_reselling_bucees_in_the_news/) & [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/jn2gng/case_study_buying_282_different_things_from_a/) on Reddit.

  
I saw the idea and felt it was simple enough to replicate considering I have several Buc-ee's in my area. I did want to differentiate my business from the others though, so I decided to add rare snacks to my catalog in addition to Buc-ee's stuff. 

  
Wanted to take full advantage of my burst of motivation (I'm a 'lazy' entreprenuer who gets lots of those, but I burn out quickly), so I created accounts on Etsy & Shopify, made a logo via Canva and designed my website within 24 hours. Initially, I got only around $500 in sales with $200 in profit in that first month (Aug. 2023).  
By September, I was hitting 1-2 sales a day on Etsy as well as Shopify, and fully sourcing foreign snacks by popular brands (i.e. Doritos, Oreos, Cheetos, Fanta, KitKat), as well as the Buc-ee's items, from stores in my area.   


The turning point came when I created an Amazon account, which was sometime in late September. I had already spent a bunch of money paying for an LLC, UPS mailbox, buying lots of marketing materials, etc. to try to beef up my brand. NGL, the Amazon marketplace is a complicated BEAST, but luckily, I stumbled onto it when no one else was really on there selling Buc-ee's stuff.  


By October, I decided to upload some snacks and Buc-ee's merch. I started with the Buc-ee's beaver onesie as well as some holiday-themed items. Within weeks those items all took off and I was hitting a few thousand in sales thanks to Halloween. 

By November-December, I was around $8k in sales thanks to the holidays. By then, I was literally getting dozens of orders a day where I was shipping out individual holiday themed snacks, my personally curated holiday-themed snack boxes, holiday/gift merch, and of course buc-ee's items galore.

Here's a photo of just what a typical day of packing orders looked like: https://imgur.com/a/4J69y5g This isn't even half of the orders on a regular day. It was a lot and would take hours of packing. 

  
By January 2024, I'd hit a little over $15k in revenue with a little over $6k in profit. The business has been life-changing... and demanding... There's a lot I realized I didn't know about scaling a business, logistics, handling demand, etc.

  
It's now Apr. 2024 and my sales have slowed down significantly. I'm doing around $5k monthly in revenue and $2k in profit. I deliberately stopped working at the business, because I was quite literally a one-woman show, and I was TOTALLY BURNT OUT. 

I'm slowly rebuilding though...It's still just me, but I'm looking for extra hands now to assist with scaling and customer service, while also considering 3PL/FBA. I've also found distributors for some of my foreign snacks, which is a blessing, because this will drive down the cost of most of my items (outside of those expensive Buc-ee's things of course). I've recently been approved for brand registry on Amazon, so I imagine my sales will only grow from here.   
TL;DR: Started a business after reading an idea on reddit. Overall, I've done over 60k in revenue using an existing business model and replicating it. Feel free to hop on the bandwagon and replicate the idea. 

I just started a YT channel and will be documenting my scaling of this business and my journey as a health-conscious serial entrepreneur who builds businesses based on case studies I've found on Reddit/Twitter. I emphasize health-conscious, because I know hustle culture can prioritize making money & burning out over well-being...That's not my thing...
