Just a roadmap list of things I'd like to implement over time.
Tricky part is not spending too much time on it while planning on monetizing it.

1. Very top of funnel should be keyword filtering (a lot of keywords)
2. Summarize using cheaper model 
3. Finetune 3.5-turbo LLM from examples - cheaper, better 
4. Create funnel with cheap models at top of funnel - cheaper
5. Certainty with different models and averaged out - better, more expensive
6. Package to monetize
