The Art of High Level Sales,"So you've been looking at improving some sales skills or getting into sales as a career. Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this obviously. While sales comes naturally to some, there is a collection of small details you can take from each to improve your game. Some are naturally great a building rapport, some just speak with confidence, or some just have that natural aura that people feel comfortable around them. Those secrets will be exactly what this series covers. Starting with understanding how high level sales is an art form that can be replicated. 
  

  

  

  

  

  
One of the saddest mistakes a large majority of business owners and sales managers make is not training their sales people. Not having the right tools to perform the job leads to mediocre performance and high turnover rate. Sales is stressful enough, then add figuring it all out on your own. Most sales reps just mimic what they saw before and hope that works. You need to educated yourself. You'll hear me say this a lot throughout this series. 
  

  

  

  
Everything Is Hard Until You Understand It. 
  

  

  

  
Jiujitsu is an extremely technical sport. The better your technique the better you perform. Black belts take about 10 years to get on average. Just a decade of repetition and improving your skill set. Michael Phelps swam 8 hours a day for years without missing a day. Just improving technique and skills.  Imagine if you put that kind of effort into improving your sales technique and skills. 
  

  

  

  
While sales is hard to feel comfortable in at first. This playbook will give you the foundation early on to start succeeding and near the end, if you are following everything, you should be exceeding all your other reps. I'm going to teach you rapport building like I learned when I was a Human Intelligence Collector in the army. For those of you that don't know, that's the guy that does interrogations and convinces people to spy on their friends for our interest.
  

  

  

  
We will be going over how to approach, where to look, posture, your tone, active listening, building a network and so much more. Everything I've learned over the last 14 years of doing every type of sales and always coming out on top. 
  

  

  

  
That's it for now. Pt. 2 will be Understanding the Sales Process. I'm going to cover an ideal sales process and how approaching it as a step by step system will significantly reduce the stress and give you confidence to close more consistently.

If you are in sales or interested in getting into sales, feel free to send me any questions you might have. I have no problem helping give some advice. I don't charge you for anything unless we're doing real coaching. If you have any request for information to be added to the playbook, just let me know. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  I want this to be a tool you can use over and over for your entire career. Thank for you time. See you on the next one.

1bj7m89,,,,,,,,1710918831.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1bj7m89/is_it_really_possible_to_get_rich_from_nothing_or/,Is it really possible to get rich from nothing or should I stay REALISTIC??,"So, I’m a 20M. I’m in my second year of medical school in my country. I‘m the oldest and only boy in a family of 7. My family falls in the category of lower middle class with lots of financial constraints.   


My parents are getting old and tired from the low quality of food and life and the tons of efforts they exert to keep this family alive, and I’m really grateful for that.

My question is that can I really get rich if I educate myself and work for it??? Or is it just a pink dream??

I’m asking this question because medicine doesn’t pay the bills in my country. Doctors work in the hospitals for minimum wage. 140 usd a month for a family of 4 is impossible. Not to mention how badly they’re treated and how long they work. 

It’s just not worth it.

&#x200B;

I‘d rather be own boss and work on my own thing.   
I’ve started to learn copywriting and this opened up my eyes. I know that it’s going to super hard. 

I find that I have to study an insane amount of things. Even more than what I study in med school. 

Writing emails, sales pages, funnels, etc. Prospecting, and outreach. Sales, and marketing. Studying my market and my niche and knowing how to give a high quality service. 

It‘s way harder than medicine because it’s all on me. 

My goal is to gain enough experience as a freelancer in these things and then start turning it into a business like an agency for example, and get into the world of business from there.

I’m practically starting form nothing. All I have is my phone and tablet. 

Is this goal worth it?? Will business relieve my financial constraints and help me provide the best life possible for my family?? Or is it just a pink dream the online gurus sell to young men like me???

&#x200B;

If it’s the right thing to do, I’ll be more than thankful for any tips or advice.

For me keeping my community/customers engaged was always a challenge and we did gamification albeit manually and with a lot of headache. So we thought to ourselves maybe why not build the tools to do this? Any perspective on this area?

We decided on $5000 on pre-revenue and he paid me $2500 without any long and deep due diligence but then he disappeared for 15 days, and there was no contact, I tried to reach him numerous times during these 15 days but no response. Then he replied and asked me to work for him even during the acquisition.   


we decided on the cost and started work for him with one of my colleagues. I paid my colleague a good advance amount and did ask my client to pay me but he said he would pay soon because he didn't do any due diligence and pay me without any delay in the start. I trusted him and we started working. 

&#x200B;

The work was way way more than what was decided. And I didn't charge for most of the small gigs as a goodwill gesture. And then came a makeover of this product. So I again asked for the remaining $2500 which was the acquisition cost and then the remaining cost up till that date of work. Which was around $1200. So total pending up till now was $3700.   


Then he said he needed to show a demo to one of his clients. At that point, I got to know that he was upselling the product but it was not my concern. I needed the money which was due at the first place. Then he ghosted me again for 8 days and suddenly he paid the remaining $2500 of the original acquisition cost then the Christmas holidays came and he just disappeared again for 22 days. 

&#x200B;

And then when he approached me, his tone was different. We worked so much on the makeover that the designs kept on coming, nothing was decided, and there were no boundaries set to the project I was afraid to ask anything because I wanted to get paid, I was not working on anything else, its going to be my bread and butter for the past 2 months and next 2 months. One night there was a bug in the app and he threatened me that he would stop working with me if I didn't make things right within one night so I keep working all night.  


I was disturbed and nervous but then I decided to ask for my payments. He said that he already paid, I told him that was the acquisition cost and then he said okay, transfer the ownership to him and he will pay, I transferred the ownership of the GitHub repo and he ghosted me for 26 days. I kept asking about the progress etc but he didn't reply then one night the app was down and he came back to me. I told him to pay then I would work on it, he said just turn on the app and he would pay right away.   


And the same thing happened again, that SOB ghosted me again. Now he said there were some negligible bugs, and he knows that I can solve those but according to him he pays only when the app was bug free. I even told him to pay in installments but he said no, he will not pay anything. And then he texted to part ways because it is not working.   


But today I am launching that app again and decided never to sell it again and increase the MRR to 10K.

I believed these people got lots of visitors and definitely customers who pay. Stories I heard a long time ago made me think this was true.

**We launched on Product Hunt on 1st of September.**

The month before, we worked hard to get ready. We did hackathons to make our product better and prepared a lot.

We worked all day and night, got lots of votes, lots of visitors, and hoped a lot.

**And**  
**We won.**

We were mentioned in Product Hunt's newsletters,  
Got a lot of backlinks,  
And many people talked about us on social media.  
We spent thousands on AI,  
And hundreds of hours making improvements we thought were important

...

But, as time went by, no visitors turned into customers. Even worse, we couldn't get any feedback from users. At the same time The Product Hunt community is overkind, so we didn't get real feedback there as well We didn't know what to do next.

**Our hope from winning on Product Hunt wasn't real.**  
In fact we didn't get any customers who pay from that launch.

We got into a classical trap: People like to make things simple. We want success fast and try to find shortcuts. But there's no easy way, and it's hard to deal with these feelings.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Every product takes a long time to succeed, and founders change things many times to find the right path.

We did too.  
Two months after launching, we added the payment wall.  
We started getting customers, having today over 100 paying customers  
And we're still making changes.  
We still are not happy with the progress.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell):

> In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem.
 
After a few years of helping developers review code, I came up with 10 code smells and how to fix them while building my project [Axolo](https://axolo.co).

### 🧐 Refactoring Large or Complex Methods

Navigating through methods that sprawl across numerous lines or twist into complexity can be daunting. Simplification is key!

The fix? Employ a linter to enforce a maximum number of lines. Deconstruct these behemoths into smaller, more focused methods, each dedicated to a singular task.

### 🤔 Addressing Long Parameter Lists

A lot of parameters can muddle method signatures, making them prone to mistakes.

The fix? Consolidate related parameters into a single object. Adopt the ""parameter object"" pattern to streamline your functions, enhancing their readability and maintainability.

### 🙄 Minimizing Excessive Comments

An overload of comments often signals that the code isn't speaking for itself as clearly as it should.

The fix? Strive for code that explains itself through judicious naming and structure. Reduce reliance on comments, allowing the code's purpose and function to be immediately apparent.

### 🤦 Eliminating Duplicate Code

Repetitive code fragments are not just a nuisance; they complicate updates and can introduce inconsistencies.

The fix? Seek out and consolidate repetitive code segments into common functions. Adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle simplifies future maintenance and modifications.

### 😕 Harmonizing Inconsistent Naming Conventions

Naming chaos confounds understanding and introduces potential errors.

The fix? Commit to a unified naming convention. Names that are clear and consistent pave the way for code that's more approachable and decipherable.

### 😬 Enhancing Error Handling

Neglecting comprehensive error management can lead to erratic behavior and a codebase that's tough to sustain.

The fix? Embrace thorough error management. Logically log and manage exceptions to bolster the code's stability and dependability.

### 🤯 Simplifying Overused If/Else Constructs

An abundance of if/else branches can tangle code, making it challenging to read and adjust.

The fix? Lean on data structures or design patterns, such as polymorphism, to untangle complex logic, thereby enhancing the code's legibility and adaptability.

### 👎 Refining Inheritance Usage

Inappropriate reliance on inheritance can entangle code further, reducing its adaptability.

The fix? Verify that inheritance is used judiciously. Opt for composition over inheritance to achieve a code structure that's more flexible and straightforward to maintain. 

Be honest, which one do you usually see in your PR? If you think I'm missing something, let me know in the comments!",False,0.0128499999999999,The post is focused on software engineering best practices rather than seeking development services.

\- I already spent way too much time on features that are rarely used. Extremely hard to find the balance between quality and overengineering.

\- Marketing is overrated, if the product is good people will come. 

\- Multiple currency support is super important, received a lot of feedback about this.

The idea being I will fully take over their business in the next year as the original owner retires. There is to be no cost/financial gain per se to the owner, as I will be taking over their liabilities and covering them (insurance wise) for the next 12 years. That is the deal. I will however have to cover costs during the handover such as purchase of equipment, legal costs and the transition month where they pull their money out of the business and I’ll be liable for the overheads during the month of transition where costs are coming in, but I won’t yet have had a full month of work to invoice yet (if that makes sense).

Prior to takeover I’ll be joining the business as an equity director to get upto speed with their projects and get to know their clients for a period of ~6 months. I’ll be bringing in work during this time (currently equal to 25% of their current income). My question is how do we decide the share allocation during this period?

They have proposed two solutions:

1. When I join I get a % of shares based on the work I’m bringing in. My concern with this is there is then no flex for if I bring in more work.

2. They charge my existing company as if I were a client for the work their staff do on my jobs. My concern with that is that takes all the profit out of my work. I’m effectively giving them that work for “free”.

I’m sure there are other options. I just feel like neither are the right fit yet, but I can’t think of what would work best. They are good people and we are all working in good faith towards this goal. Would really appreciate suggestions, thank you all.

The concept has already been proven to work as there are a few businesses doing well at this. I just think they could be done better, smoother and with cleaner UIs.

I recently stopped working for a SaaS startup who was doing something similar but more complex and for a more specific industry. So I'm taking what I learned from there and using it to build my own platform.

Using a no-code platform might not work based on my research (please prove me wrong). I've done some Javasctipt coding before and believe that using React to build this platform will be the best way to do it (The startup I left also used React to build theirs)

With my very limited coding experience, I plan on building this platform focusing on the core features first before releasing it.

Without giving too much away, the main feature is based around a kanban board style of management.

I don't know all the available resources that could be used to build something like this and would appreciate any advice or information please.

*Background:* I have an [older version of PhotoSwipe working on my site](https://photo.2re.net/) but I am learning Vue and the old version uses jQuery and jQuery conflicts with Vue.

All I want to do at this point is to use the code on the [Getting Started](https://photoswipe.com/getting-started/) page to work so I can figure it out from there.

It says you need the Core, Ligthbox, and the CSS.

I linked the css in the head like it says so I don't think that's the issue. My guess is that I'm putting the JavaScript in the wrong place but I'm not sure.

I've tried putting the JS code in a script tag before the HTML code, after it, making a separate JS file and linking to it in the head, linking to `photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js` and `photoswipe/photoswipe.esm.js` in the head, but nothing seems to work. I thought maybe the there was some kind of configuration on my computer not allowing me to execute JavaScript locally or something, so I uploaded my different versions to a web server and it still didn't work.

Help! What's going on?

 `// Include Lightbox`   
`import PhotoSwipeLightbox from '/photoswipe/photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js';`

After my last launch on Product Hunt didn't get featured, I spent quite a bit of time reflecting and asking myself why it didn't make the cut. It was a bit disheartening, to be honest. However, Product Hunt recently shed some light on this very topic, sharing key reasons why products might not get the spotlight we hope for.

Here's a quick list they shared that I'm keeping for next time:

* It's gotta be a SaaS product, not something like a PDF.
* Don't forget to add a maker comment for engagement.
* Check your links; broken ones are a big no.
* Schedule your launch ahead of time.
* No repeats; make sure your launch is fresh.
* Big updates only, no minor tweaks.
* Be clear in your tagline about what your product does.

Given the limited screen size of mobile devices, it's essential to keep the interface uncluttered by minimizing the number of buttons, popups, and links.

Enter the sticky action button.

This engaging feature offers an easy way for website owners to increase conversions from mobile visitors.

**Benefits of using Sticky Action Buttons**

**1. Offers better engagement:** Sticky buttons are like sticky notes on your fridge that remind you to do something. Whether the user scrolls up or down the page, the sticky button is there to remind them to take a particular action.

**2. Higher quality conversions:** Studies have shown that in the last 15 years, the average attention span has dropped from 12 to 8 seconds. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that visitors who scroll through your website or spend more time than average on it are demonstrating a certain level of interest in what you have to offer.

Automate your sticky action button to appear when the visitor has either scrolled a certain percentage of the screen or spent an amount of time on the page. Presenting your call-to-action at the moment where the visitor has shown some certain level of commitment can improve conversions.

**3. Draw visitor's attention with animations:** We’re naturally drawn to movement, so an animated sticky action button is bound to draw a visitor's attention. The animation should be subtle, in a way to nudge the visitor to click the button, but not in an intrusive way that it becomes irritating.  This is one you’d have to test to find out what works best for your brand.

**Don’t take my word for it, here are examples of popular brands using Sticky action buttons as part of their conversion toolkit.**

1. Basecamp - $374.8M/yr
2. Riverside Fm - $30.3M/yr
3. Mfino - $1.42M/mo
4. Just Call - $1.6M/mo

## The product

ColdClicks is an AI based cold email personalization tool so naturally it made sense to use the tool to market itself.  The way it works is, you upload your leads, the tool researches each lead then uses AI to write the first line of your email.

This makes each email you send hyper-personalized, and relevant to the recipient, which significantly improves your reply rates. It also saves so much time compared to doing it manually.

We've been bullish on the idea of cold email being an incredible growth channel for bootstrapped startups for a while - it's very low cost yet highly scalable, so we decided to put our idea to the test.

## How we did it

First we identified our target market. There's a lot of ways we could've gone with this, but we started with lead generation agencies as these are the guys sending the most email, and an increasing reply rate will directly increase their bottom line.

We built a small, lead list targeting small lead gen agency owners based in the US. The contents of the email were very brief:

>Hey {{firstName}},  
>  
>{{personalization}}  
>  
>Reaching out because I noticed you're doing a lot of lead generation.  
>  
>We've built an AI tool that generates highly-personalized emails at scale to improve your reply rate.  
>  
>Would you be open to learning a bit more about this?

Of course, we used ColdClicks to personalize each lead based on their company website! Overall we got over a 21% reply rate, 6 trial sign-ups, and 1 paid conversion.

## Goals

As the internet is pushing against spray & pray models of outreach, with more platforms putting restrictions on high volume campaigns, it's important to make each email count. Personalized openers help significantly with this, they're the best way to grab the prospect's attention, and let them know the email is relevant to them and to keep reading.

I am writing this post after over 8 months of in-depth research on software developer salaries.  


This post will showcase how foreigners and web platforms exploit Small American Business with foreign labor, for example:  
\- Why Upwork forces buyers to pay freelancers by the hour?  
\- What is the real cost of living in other countries?  
\- How much do experienced software and web developers actually earn in foreign countries?  
\- How YOU as an American entrepreneur is getting screwed?

  
**REPEAT AFTER ME - In third world countries (India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, Venezuela, Brazil etc) workers DO NOT get paid by the hour.**

  
So why this culture of hourly wage for software developers online?

  
Before we answer this question, let's look at some things.  


* **Most freelancers are from Asia, South America and Eastern Europe where the salaries and cost of living is super low.**
* Most of the world sees Americans as rich, spoiled and completely unaware of what is going on in the world. And this is somewhat true.
* Hourly rate on Upwork and other freelance sites is highly inflated. To US buyers $20/hr may seem like a good deal but you are actually getting ripped-off. $20/hr is MORE than what Americans get paid for the same work in many parts of our own country.  

* Let me give you an example -  
$20 x 40 hours = $800.00 per week  
$3200.00 per month (post tax), this is salary for developers in many small towns of America, even today!
* So why are you paying foreigners who is low-skilled and has cost of living less than one-tenth of Americans?  
You are hiring a subpar ""freelance"" developer who doesn't really care about your work, works whenever he feels like & charges you 3x-4x  more than what Google pays their engineers in India. FACT!

**WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING HERE**

* Most workers on these freelance websites like Upwork, Freelancer etc are not good designers or developers. They are the leftovers, the people who were not good enough to be hired by local companies or international tech companies.
* Then there are these ""agencies"" run by code-pimps - a non-technical businessman, calling himself project manager. This guy hires non-english speaking developers for salaries that are even lower than local rates, exploiting them. There are many of them on Upwork, most from India, Pakistan, South America and Ukraine.  

* **MY SALARY AND COL DATA IS ACCURATE**
* I spoke to various reputed recruiters and companies who hire developers in India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, China and Ukraine.
* DO NOT trust the salary sites on the internet. Most salary data on these sites is crowdsourced and guess what happens when you crowdsource? Numbers get highly inflated by the coders themselves.  
**The problem is as Americans, everything we do is in English, open and available on the internet. But we know nothing about foreign lands. Especially third & forth world countries. Their local sites are in languages that we do not understand, so we are totally clueless to what actual wages are.**  
*The foreigners on sites like Upwork know our local salaries. But how do you find costs and salaries of the world?*
* Do you know the cost of decent lunch in Beijing? What about a nice rental apartment in Surat India or 10 mile taxi ride in Kiev or Caracas? You do not. And that's where you lose!
* Idiots will say I am talking like a privileged American. That I am not. I am a foreigner myself, who loves to travel, pay people well for what they are worth, so they live well WHERE THEY LIVE, based on their local wages.
* This post may get a lot of flack on a far-left website like Reddit. But everything in this post is factual.
* ***Freelancer sites like Upwork have created a culture of inflated hourly rates to boost their own company earnings. But guess who gets shafted, YOU, the buyer.*** The American small business owner. The entrepreneur.  
You will get screwed by workers in India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine or any of the South American countries. Period.
* I have compiled list of ACTUAL developer salaries from various countries. There will be many naysayers and folks who will say my numbers are wrong, but **THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY 100% ACCURATE REAL MONTHLY SALARIES OF AVERAGE PROGRAMMERS** in these countries. 
* Some may even throw words like ""slavery"" and ""racism"" , ""taking advantage of poor people"" ""being cheap"" etc etc. Those statements are invalid and does not negate facts.
* **Running a business is about being frugal and smart, being aware of what's going around you.**
* Cost of living in these countries is super low. Anyone disputing my factual data has an underlying devious motive.  
So here is the ACTUAL Developer salaries and COL data from various major cities around the world which took me months to collect, analyze and verify.

* **As Americans, it is hard for us to even imagine any salary below $10 per hour. But that is the case for most of the world outside of North America & Western Europe.** 
* The salaries for places I listed are NOT low, they afford perfectly decent living conditions locally.  

* So next time you hire a programmer, coder, developer for your project from Upwork or any third-world country through any platform, remember these people think you are foolish & that you are completely unaware of local wages. 

&#x200B;

* So how much will you pay for your next project, you American idiot? :)

I would like to get some insights or advices  on acquiring customers. The title says promotional marketing items industry, but it is a little broader, which later I will explain.


My mother is planning on opening her own business, where the main strength is her connections and ability to decrease the costs of projects by 30-40% when compared to local market.

She has approximately 15 years of experience of working with promotional marketing projects and things around, mainly for FMCG industry (think in terms shampoo stands in market where only products from Nivea are present, branded items for companies like hoodies, hats, powerbanks, brochures delivery and distribution to clients via mail in big quantities, etc.). The role of her company is mainly to be a supplier/middleman of things and services mentioned above. Currently for example she is managing inventory for online store of one of the clients, where she find the suppliers, introduce new items, etc.

Her clients were companies like Hyundai, Procter&Gamble, Heineken, and many similar in size, projects were sometimes on country level or global level.


But in all of the cases, the clients were coming to their company by themselves, or were acquired by different department, so my mom didn't had insights into that.



Now when it comes to starting the business, the something what I would like to hear some opinions about is marketing strategies.

First of all, she has Non-compete clause for 6 months (if she quits), which forbid her to reach out to current clients of her company, but that's fine, because the sizes of projects and required budget for payments are too big for starting. 
She would like to start from the beginning, to get traction, and when the finances will go well, focus on it fully.


First ideas how to start to get some traction and projects is:
*Public tenders (basing on historic data, she sees that she could easily outbid competitors)
*Reaching out by cold calling/emailing to local companies like hers in the industry asking for becoming sub supplier for some of the projects
*Targeted advertisement on LinkedIn towards profiles from sectors where the most clients are coming from in her current company


As the beginning, I think she should create the website with some study cases as examples, where visitors could see possibilities of cost savings thanks to her work.

If it useful, she is operating mainly for regions like BeNeLux/Europe. (As some stragies may be completely different for asia, etc)",False,0.01193,"The post discusses strategies for a promotional marketing items business, not a software startup."

For a bit of context, I am a propulsion engineer and have a comprehensive knowledge of jet engines, how they’re put together, and how they operate. 

What started as a passion project of designing (in CAD) my own jet engine has morphed into a business idea of producing and selling it as a DIY STEM kit. The plan is for it to come in a kit (miniature toolbox that I make via laser cutter), complete with colored instructions and education insights into theory of operation, how gearboxes work, the purpose of an adjustable exhaust nozzle, etc. 

My engine will be fully motorized with adjustable controls (w a digital RPM readout), interactive with removable parts, audio/visual effects, and a simulated afterburner (made with a fog machine, LED, and fan). It will be 3D printed but also uses real hardware, servos, magnets, electronics, etc. 

I am roughly halfway done designing/testing it and am hoping to complete it by this fall. I have no doubt that there is a community that would be interested in this, but I wanted some business advice, thoughts on how viable of an idea this is, and how I can shape this into a legitimate company. My jet engine is designed to be scalable and I have other ideas for jet engine models (turboprop engines, concept futuristic type engines, etc ). Also,  I plan on selling this online but I am open to other options and opportunities related to its STEM content.

However, seeing as they were sold to Squarespace, I recently found myself in need of a replacement. I did a bit of looking around and figured that I would share what I learned in case it's helpful to anyone else.

**Best domain registrars**

There were a few registrars that kept showing up more often than any others. They usually had glowing reviews, and few to no complaints. Here they are in approximate order of how commonly they were recommended:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)
- [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/)
- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)

One catch with Cloudflare is that you are locked into using their DNS.

**Dishonorable mention**

Most people recommended avoiding GoDaddy due to poor customer service and scummy business practices such as price hikes and buying up domains that people search for.

**Final thoughts**

Instead of looking on a registrar, you can use [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/en) to check domain availability.

Feel free to share your experiences with these registrars or add any options I may have missed in the comments.

About the tip I've used to raise from VCs, it's pretty straigthforward but no one does it:

1. Visit the investor website.
2. Go through their portfolio companies.
3. Find founders that are in a similar industry as your company, or founders that you think would find your startup interesting.
4. Connect with founders through email or LinkedIn asking about their VC.
5. Ask for a 15min. video call, share your story and offer help.
6. If the chemistry is good, kindly ask for a warm intro to the investor.

Really, this is the way I found the lead investor for my biggest round! The amazing thing about this is that sometimes even the founder gets involved with you to see the best way to generate FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) with the investor. Yes, you'll get some mean ""No's"" along the way from stuck-up founders, but if you don't have a track record of a $100M exit, or your parents weren't VC's classmates in Standford, this is the best way to build a strong network.

Also, for the investor, having two different data sources saying you're speaking with many funds and founders helps a lot pushing them forward.

  
A last thing, I'm also building an AI tool to help with this entire process: 1) finding the best matches inside an even bigger database than the excel I'm sharing based on thesis, portfolio companies, and many data points, 2) Giving full contact information of all team members of the fund and their portfolio founders. If someone is interested too, please let me know!

To start this journey, I drew inspiration from various solopreneurs on Twitter, X, and through reading posts in this subreddit and Indiehackers blog.

## Inspiration

Throughout this journey, I encountered remarkable solopreneurs such as:

1. [Marc Louvin](https://twitter.com/marc_louvion) **(marketing, fast shipping, SEO)**
2. [John Rush](https://twitter.com/johnrushx) **(marketing, SEO, SaaS apps)**
3. [Dan Kulkov](https://twitter.com/DanKulkov) **(marketing)**
4. [Nico Jeannen](https://twitter.com/nico_jeannen) **(Facebook ads)**
5. [Philipp Keller](https://twitter.com/philkellr) **(SEO)**

Who were helpful enough to share their journey in public. Reading tweets from them started leaving impressions of ideas in my mind and thereby shaping my thinking to build apps in a better form. 

## Observation

Inspired by these solopreneurs, I learned and implemented their strategies. I realized they were part of a bigger picture – ideas for creating a profitable SaaS product. So, I decided to create a comprehensive guide called the **""Successful Solopreneur Guide""** to help others succeed in creating one.

## Organizing

I began bookmarking tweets, blog posts, and Reddit entries related to SaaS development and organizing them into sections like marketing, SEO, and branding.

## Solopreneur guide content structure 

The guide has three sections:

1. Marketing (20 to 30% complete)
2. SEO (basics covered + 1 approach to increase DA + 2 successful profiles)

   2. SEO fundamental basics like what is DA, what is on-page SEO, and three important elements of on page SEO
   3. Running SEO on autopilot and how Wilson Wilson did it for Senja.io and grew its DA from 1 to 68 in a year
   4. Successful profiles
      1. John Rush's 7 Low Hanging SEO Fixes for busy Founders (Part 2)

   1. Twitter/X growth strategy

The guide is a collection of important SaaS-related Twitter/X links with additional information added wherever necessary.

The aim of the [Successful Solopreneur guide](https://cookiewriter.com/successful-solopreneur) as mentioned earlier is to help as many people as possible with building a profitable SaaS with the experiences from successful solopreneurs all organised in one place.

USE the tools out there,"I’ve launched 3 SaaS websites in the past year and if there is one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you should never try to implement something that you could use a tool for instead

I’ve started with Brideabi where I did everything myself ([read more](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/s/wJslLWYNN0))
, continued with [TLPrinting](https://tlprinting.net) where I did a pretty decent job and finally [Vojo](https://vojo.app) where I absolutely nailed it!

The problem

As an engineer, it’s easy to fall in the trap of the desire to implement everything by yourself, especially if you haven’t built something yet (for example an invoicing module) or to be afraid of so many 3rd party dependencies.. and as an engineer, you would be right, but not as a startup founder!

You see, the problem is that implementing all these features takes a lot of time and they will certainly have issues that will increase the required time. When you are building a new SaaS, it’s important to get your product in front of your users as fast as possible to get feedback the soonest

And the worst part is, next time you will need something similar, you will very likely have a completely different tech stack and you won’t even be able to reuse your old code.

I agree that reducing the number of third party dependencies is important, but only after you have your PMF and you know it’s worth investing in the product in such a way

Some examples of what I did right and wrong.

1. In case of Brideabi I did everything myself. I’ve already talked about it on the link above so I’m not going to go into more details here

2. For [TLPrinting](https://tlprinting.net) I’ve done a lot better job. 
- For backend, I’ve used firebase. It also manages authentication so I’ve hit two birds with one bullet.
- For subscription management, I’m  completely relaying on Stripe, no need to store my users in my database when I can ask Stripe for the info.. well, for technical reasons, there would be, but again, in the first phase, it’s completely fine
- What I did do that good, is that I’ve build a messaging form with completely custom code.. and it has some major issues and limitations

3. In case of [Vojo](https://vojo.app) I’ve managed to raise this to an even higher level

- I’ve used Supabase as backend which from the perspective of this post is very similar to firebase but offers even more possibilities to have code in the backend (for free)
- For customer support I’ve used Brevo, it’s super easy to integrate and offers not only email marketing tools but also pop-up chat
- And of course stripe will be the source of truth for memberships but it’s not integrated yet

Conclusion

When launching a product, you need to forget about your engineering side and look for shortcuts. But don’t forget to always keep the door open for change if anything goes wrong!

After a year of me running it on the side while having a full time job, it was clear the best way forward was to sell for a variety of reasons. We decided hiring a new manager and scraping off the top wasn't logistically feasible. 

We spent \~6 months trying to find a private buyer but ultimately now have the business listed with a broker. There are several low but encouraging offers within the first week so it's looking like it will sell soon-ish. The deal being presented to potential buyers is a one-year leaseback to give us time to wind down operations, although a buyer could of course make an offer to take over sooner.

We currently have \~3-4 full time employees and 5-part time. They are all aware of the situation and the most critical employees are willing to stick it out since most of them have been with the company for \~30 years and are nearing retirement. We are of course hoping to give a generous severance (\~2 years) if at all possible. The family member who passed had little in retirement, so we have to be sure his spouse has plenty for retirement. 

Are there any words of wisdom or cautionary tales as we approach closer to selling? We have an accountant that will help, but should we look to hiring a business lawyer and/or financial advisor? Due to the death, there is a very important opportunity for the step-up in basis which we want to be sure is fully utilized to our advantage.

After spending over 8 months digging deep into software developer salaries, I've got some eye-opening stuff to share.

Ever wondered how foreigners and online platforms take advantage of small American businesses with foreign labor? I'm talking about things like why Upwork insists on hourly payments for freelancers, or what the real cost of living is in other countries, or even how much experienced software and web developers actually make abroad. And guess what? You, yes you, as an American entrepreneur, are getting the short end of the stick.  


**Here's a shocker: In third world countries like India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, Venezuela, Brazil, etc., workers don't get paid by the hour. So why the heck is there this culture of hourly wages for software developers online?**  


Before I dive into that, let's set the scene. Most freelancers are from places where the cost of living is dirt cheap compared to the U.S. And guess how ***Americans are seen? Rich, spoiled, and totally clueless about the world around them. Ouch, but kinda true.***

  
Now, brace yourself: The hourly rates on platforms like Upwork are massively inflated. Sure, $20/hr might seem like a steal to you, but in reality, you're getting ripped off. That $20/hr? That's more than what many Americans earn for the same gig in small towns across our own country.  
Let's do some math: $20 x 40 hours = $800 a week. That's $3200 a month after taxes – which is what developers in many small American towns make, even today!

  
So, why on earth are you shelling out big bucks to foreigners who are less skilled and live in places where the cost of living is a fraction of what it is in the U.S.? You're basically hiring a subpar ""freelance"" developer who couldn't care less about your project, works whenever they feel like it, and charges you 3x-4x more than what Google pays their engineers in India. Yep, that's a fact!  


Now, let's talk about what's really going down here. Most of the workers on platforms like Upwork and Freelancer? They're not exactly top-notch designers or developers. They're the rejects, the ones who couldn't land a job with local or international tech companies.  


And then there are these so-called ""agencies"" run by code-pimps – non-technical businessmen posing as project managers. They hire non-English speaking developers for peanuts, exploiting them to no end. You'll find heaps of them on Upwork, mostly from places like India, Pakistan, South America, and Ukraine.  


Oh, and in case you're wondering, my salary and cost of living data are spot on. I've spoken to tons of reputable recruiters and companies across India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, China, and Ukraine.  


Don't bother with those salary sites on the internet – most of that data is crowdsourced, and you know what happens then? The numbers get pumped up by these offshore coders themselves.  


**Here's the thing: As Americans, everything we do is in English and out there on the internet for all to see. But when it comes to foreign lands, we're clueless. Their local sites are in languages we don't understand, so we're totally in the dark about actual wages.**  


Critics might say I'm talking like a privileged American, but that's far from the truth. I'm a foreigner myself who loves to travel and believes in paying people what they're worth, so they can live well – based on their local wages.  


This post might ruffle some feathers on a far-left website like Reddit, but every word of it is fact. Freelancer sites like Upwork have created a culture of inflated hourly rates to line their own pockets. But who gets screwed over? You – the American small business owner, the entrepreneur.  


You'll be taken for a ride by workers in India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, or any South American country. Period.  


**I've painstakingly compiled a list of ACTUAL developer salaries from various countries. Sure, there'll be naysayers and folks who claim my numbers are off, but guess what? They're ABSOLUTELY 100% ACCURATE.**  


Some might throw around words like ""slavery,"" ""racism,"" ""taking advantage of poor people,"" or ""being cheap."" But those words mean diddly squat when faced with the facts.  


Running a business is all about being smart and frugal, and being aware of what's happening around you. And let me tell you, the cost of living in these countries is dirt cheap. Anyone arguing with my data has some ulterior motive.  


So, without further ado, here are the ACTUAL developer salaries and cost of living data from various major cities around the world. It took me months to gather, analyze, and verify this info. And just a heads up: most foreigners looking for work on these platforms fall into the Junior category.

Now, we Americans might struggle to wrap our heads around salaries below ten bucks an hour. But guess what? That's the reality for most of the world outside of North America and Western Europe.  
Don't get it twisted though – the salaries I listed ain't pocket change. They're enough to live decently in these parts of the world.  


So, next time you're scouting a programmer, coder, or developer for your project, whether it's on Upwork or some other platform from a third-world country, just remember – these folks think you're clueless about local wages.
