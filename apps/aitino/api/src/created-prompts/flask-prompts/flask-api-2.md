**Prompt:**

I'm currently developing a web application and have decided to use Flask for creating an API. I've heard that Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework that's widely used for building web applications in Python, but I'm not very familiar with it yet. Could you provide me with a detailed overview of Flask, specifically focusing on its use for API development? Please include:

1. A brief introduction to Flask and its key features.
2. How Flask can be used to create APIs, including any specific libraries or extensions that are commonly used for this purpose.
3. A simple example of a Flask API endpoint that demonstrates how to handle a GET request.
4. Best practices for structuring Flask API projects to ensure scalability and maintainability.
5. Any common challenges or pitfalls to be aware of when using Flask for API development and how to overcome them.

Additionally, if there are any recent updates or trends in the Flask community related to API development, please mention those as well. 

**Note:** While I'm looking for comprehensive information, please keep the explanation concise and targeted towards someone with intermediate Python knowledge but new to Flask and API development.
