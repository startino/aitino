## What is Aitino

Aitino is an open-source platform that allows for the creation of teams of AI Agents to help users automate high-level tasks and solve complex problems without the need for lengthy and complicated setups.
We're hoping that Aitino can go from prompt to solution in a matter of minutes while only needing seconds from the user to provide the required information like API keys, context, and specific information for the agents to solve the tasks.

Aitino takes the visual form of a node editor as we believe this is one of the easiest to implement and most scalable solutions for both us and the user. It's intuitive and can allow for highly complex teams while also remaining simple for small use cases.

Aitino is built on top of the [Autogen Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen). We also hope to merge some principles applied to other multi-agent system projects like ChatDev and CrewAI as there are some features from those that are out of reach with Autogen alone.


## Aitino Web

**Aitino Web is the cloud-hosted version of Aitino. You can try the free plan (coming soon) to see how powerful Aitino really is in a matter of minutes.**
- The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Futino/aitino/tree/alpha/apps/web).
- It uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as the framework, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, [shacn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/) for components, [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for database, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-hk) for payment processing, and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting.
