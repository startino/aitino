# Futino Business Plan

### Identity

Futino combines the upsides of a tech co-founder with a development agency, eliminating the downsides typically associated with each.

### Problem

Non-tech founders often struggle to find a reliable tech-founder or development agency to help build their idea. Agencies tend to be expensive, and freelancers may lack the necessary investment, skills, or speed. Unlike a co-founder, neither provides security or reliability, and finding a random tech co-founder online can be risky and often requires giving away a significant equity share.

### Solution

- **Partnership Model**: Acts as a co-founder to non-tech founders, offering the reliability, conviction, and passion (at a reduced cost via equity).
- **Security and Speed**: Combines the legal security and execution speed of an incorporated business.
- **Equity for Services**: Accepts 15%-30% equity in exchange for lower development costs, aligning our investment with the project's success.

### Target Market

- Non-Tech Founders with at least $5k in funding.
- Those seeking a Tech Founder or Development Agency.
- Tech Founders seeking a Non-Tech (business/sales) Founder (phase 2).

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

Our service provides non-tech founders with the dedication and passion of a tech co-founder and the professional execution of an established agency. By partnering with us, founders can efficiently and cost-effectively bring their software ideas to life, with the added benefit of strategic insights and ongoing support to ensure market success.
