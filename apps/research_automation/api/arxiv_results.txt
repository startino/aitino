Abstract: In this work, we introduce Unique3D, a novel image-to-3D framework for
efficiently generating high-quality 3D meshes from single-view images,
featuring state-of-the-art generation fidelity and strong generalizability.
Previous methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) can produce
diversified 3D results by distilling 3D knowledge from large 2D diffusion
models, but they usually suffer from long per-case optimization time with
inconsistent issues. Recent works address the problem and generate better 3D
results either by finetuning a multi-view diffusion model or training a fast
feed-forward model. However, they still lack intricate textures and complex
geometries due to inconsistency and limited generated resolution. To
simultaneously achieve high fidelity, consistency, and efficiency in single
image-to-3D, we propose a novel framework Unique3D that includes a multi-view
diffusion model with a corresponding normal diffusion model to generate
multi-view images with their normal maps, a multi-level upscale process to
progressively improve the resolution of generated orthographic multi-views, as
well as an instant and consistent mesh reconstruction algorithm called ISOMER,
which fully integrates the color and geometric priors into mesh results.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Unique3D significantly outperforms
other image-to-3D baselines in terms of geometric and textural details.

Title: From Zero to Hero: Cold-Start Anomaly Detection

Abstract: When first deploying an anomaly detection system, e.g., to detect
out-of-scope queries in chatbots, there are no observed data, making
data-driven approaches ineffective. Zero-shot anomaly detection methods offer a
solution to such "cold-start" cases, but unfortunately they are often not
accurate enough. This paper studies the realistic but underexplored cold-start
setting where an anomaly detection model is initialized using zero-shot
guidance, but subsequently receives a small number of contaminated observations
(namely, that may include anomalies). The goal is to make efficient use of both
the zero-shot guidance and the observations. We propose ColdFusion, a method
that effectively adapts the zero-shot anomaly detector to contaminated
observations. To support future development of this new setting, we propose an
evaluation suite consisting of evaluation protocols and metrics.

Title: Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes

Abstract: Although many time series are realizations from discrete processes, it is
often that a continuous Gaussian model is implemented for modeling and
forecasting the data, resulting in incoherent forecasts. Forecasts using a
Poisson-Lindley integer autoregressive (PLINAR) model are compared to
variations of Gaussian forecasts via simulation by equating relevant moments of
the marginals of the PLINAR to the Gaussian AR. To illustrate utility, the
methods discussed are applied and compared using a discrete series with model
parameters being estimated using each of conditional least squares,
Yule-Walker, and maximum likelihood.
