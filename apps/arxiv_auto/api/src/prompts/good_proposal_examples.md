Upwork proposal example #1:

Hi,

I would love to be your freelance writer and help you execute your website content strategy.

I have 5 years of experience writing content for websites, including Forbes.com, Buzzfeed.com, and more. Below, I’ve linked two samples that showcase my writing ability in a similar niche to your brand. As you can see, I understand your audience and know how to write compelling articles to get your website visitors to purchase your products.

I can complete 1,000-word articles with a 2-day turnaround time. Would that work for your needs? Let me know if my writing meets your expectations, and we can set up a time to talk about your project in more detail.
